Environment
In the performance of its activities, Ambu endeavours to assess and reduce its impact on
the environment and to contribute both directly
and indirectly to a sustainable environment.
Ambu has incorporated environmental considerations across the entire life cycle of its products, covering all stages from development via
production, distribution and use to the disposal
of waste products. The company strives to reduce the environmental impact of its production processes by minimising the consumption
of raw materials and power as well as emission
levels.
Ambu’s direct impact on the environment is
modest. The most important environmental effects in relation to production relate to the consumption of energy and raw materials and the
waste resulting therefrom. PVC is used in some
Ambu products. Waste products are disposed of
through licensed waste-processing operators.
The group emphasises the choice of environmentally sensible solutions in connection with
the heating and cooling of its buildings, and its
power and water consumption.
The plants in Denmark fall under the provisions
of Danish environmental legislation, and the
plants in China and Malaysia follow the same
environmental guidelines as the plants in Denmark.
Ambu is not party to any cases or disputes involving environmental issues. Ambu is not covered by the rules on environmental approval,
nor does it fall under the Danish act on the
presentation of ‘green accounts’.
