Corporate social responsibilityThe company’s environmental impact and its environmentalaction programme for 2007/08 were satisfactory.The dye factory, Scandye UAB, in which
Gabriel has a stake of 40%, was theobject of the vast part of Gabriel’s environmentalefforts during the year. Gabrielhas chosen the most eco-friendlytechnology, and all plant is suppliedwith control systems facilitating optimisedoperations.Gabriel is licensed to apply the EU
Flower eco-label and Oeko-Tex, with
most of its product programme beingcomprised by these schemes.
The consumers focus increasingly on securityand health, promoting the use ofdyes without heavy metals and otherhealth hazardous substances.
Gabriel’s environmental managementsystem ensures that the entire supplychain handles all environmental impactand health issues in accordance withthe cradle-to-grave principle.
New European Community Regulation
on chemicals and their safe use, REACH,
has come into force. Gabriel only applieschemicals and dyes which complywith this regulation.
During the year under review, Gabrielfurther developed its co-operation withits suppliers. Regular audits and othersupplier follow-up allow for the observanceof Gabriel’s environmental requirementsand the implementation ofrelevant initiatives. These activities alsocomprise Corporate Social Responsibility,
including, for instance, a workingenvironment assessment.Global warming produced by CO2
emissions and other greenhouse gasesposes the most important environmentalchallenge of our time. With 12 years’ ofsystematic environmental management,Gabriel has succeeded in reducing thisimpact considerably. This area hasbeen given an even higher priority andis now included in the environmentalaction programme for the comingyear.Gabriel’s environmental report can bedownloaded from the company’s website,www.gabriel.dk.
