Corporate social
responsibility (CSR)
The year 2013 was a year marked by the focus on
winding up the operating activities of NeuroSearch and
of saying goodbye to the majority of our employees. In
2012, we cancelled our participation in the UN Global
Compact, and we no longer meet the objective of filing
a Communications On Progress (COP) report. Therefore, we report solely in the actual Annual Report.

In view of its size and current activities, NeuroSearch
no longer has:

NeuroSearchâ€™s Board of Directors has decided that,
given the current circumstances, it does not make
sense to define additional targets for changing the gender distribution for the Board of Directors and Management. The Board of Directors consists of three members elected by the shareholders, of whom the Chairman is female. The Company has two employees: a
male CEO and a female CFO.

In connection with the latest reduction of staff, it was a
goal to treat all employees fairly and respectfully. We
are pleased that a large number of the employees terminated found employment elsewhere before they left
us.

the Company's activities

Working environment
The physical working environment has been simplified
in step with the reduction of activities in NeuroSearch.
After the sale of the domicile property, the address was
changed to an office partnership from where the remaining administration is handled.
No working environment surveys were made in 2013
because of the Company's size and current situation.
