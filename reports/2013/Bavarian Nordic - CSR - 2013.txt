Bavarian Nordic in Brief
Bavarian Nordic is a global company that develops and manufactures innovative vaccines and
immunotherapies for the prevention and treatment of life-threatening diseases where there
are as yet unmet needs. The Company's clinical pipeline focuses on cancer and infectious
diseases.
The Company received its first product
approval in 2013 with the marketing
authorization of the IMVANEX® smallpox vaccine in the European Union in
August. The vaccine was later approved in
Canada in November (under the name of
IMVAMUNE®). The vaccine was developed
over a number of years in a collaboration
with the U.S. government, and the Company has since 2010 supplied more than
20 million doses of the vaccine to the U.S.
Strategic National Stockpile.

The Company's other leading program is
PROSTVAC®, an immunotherapy candidate for the treatment of prostate cancer,
which is in Phase 3 clinical development.
The Company has research laboratories in
Mountain View, California, and Martinsried, Germany. The Company's head
office and production facilities are located
in Kvistgaard, Denmark.

Listed on the NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen
exchange, the Company has roughly 21
thousand shareholders.

Introduction
The year 2013 was an eventful one for
Bavarian Nordic. With our first product
approval from both the European and
Canadian drug authorities, we received a
seal of approval of our vaccine technology,
which we have developed over the past
ten-plus years. This has created a solid
platform for further development of new
vaccines: a development that is primarily
driven by contracts with the U.S. government, which sees additional potential in
our technology for use against potential
bioterror threats. The most important
thing that happened in 2013 was, however, winning a new supply contract from
the U.S. government for the continued
supply of IMVAMUNE® smallpox vaccine to
the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile.
As part of our growth strategy, we
continue to invest solidly in the development of new cancer immunotherapies, for
which the pivotal product is PROSTVAC®,
our product candidate for treating prostate
cancer. In 2013, the large-scale global
Phase 3 study of PROSTVAC also reached
Denmark, where patients are now receiving treatment under the study. A total
of 1,200 patients in 15 countries are expected to be enrolled in the study, which
would form the basis for a subsequent approval of PROSTVAC, provided the results

are successful. As part of the preparations
for launching PROSTVAC, 2013 also saw us
beginning to expand our production facilities at Kvistgaard in Denmark in order to
have the capacity to manufacture several
different products there.
We successfully continued to reduce our
aggregate climate impact, reducing our
CO2 emissions by almost 9% in 2013. After
a time spent upscaling our production,
production volumes were slightly lower
in 2013 than in previous years. Combined
with significant improvements in our production process, we managed to further
reduce our consumption of energy and
raw materials.
We are focused on health and employee
well-being and were pleased to record
a drop in sickness absence among our
employees in 2013, although the rate
remained higher than the average for
Danish companies. This can mainly be
explained by the special requirements for
our production, including production staff
not being allowed to return to work until
they have completely recovered from an
illness.
Another aspect of our efforts to ensure
that we have a healthy and safe work-

place is the comprehensive occupational
environment work we do in our organisation, which includes user involvement at
all levels and in compliance with national
legislation. For this reason, we were
not satisfied to note that the number of
reported occupational accidents increased
in 2013. However, most of them were
minor accidents, a fact that is reflected in
the minimal number of related sick days.
The accidents were not related to our
working processes, but were random and
thus could not have been avoided through
our preventive work. However, our goal is
to continue to reduce the general accident
risk, paying special attention to any nearaccidents.
In 2014, our CSR work will continue to
focus primarily on environment and
staff, but we will also remain attentive
to the ever-growing wishes, demands
and requirements from the world around
us, including any new legislation. This is
something also reflected in the new goals
we have set for our CSR work in 2014 and
the years ahead, which are described in
this report.

Goals
In each of our CSR areas of focus, we will
constantly seek to improve the conditions
that can generate better business value for
the Company as part of our overall goal of
creating the greatest possible shareholder
value. For example, we will constantly work
to optimize our production processes, also

by reducing our consumption of raw materials and energy, just as we also – naturally
– continue to strive towards a well-functioning workplace with informed, satisfied and
healthy employees and the resultant lower
levels of sickness absence and occupational
accidents. These and other general goals

are fully integrated into the operation of
our business and form part of the ongoing
evaluations in the respective areas.
In addition, we have set the following
specific objectives for our CSR work for the
coming years:

Area

Bavarian Nordic and CSR
In just a few years, Bavarian Nordic has
grown from a pure research company
into a fully integrated company with
activities ranging from early research to
the in-house production of vaccines. This
transformation, combined with a high rate
of organic growth, has required a great
deal of systematic and thorough work to
adapt the organization to its new tasks as a
production company while also considering
the world around us, in order to ensure that

our operations are responsible from both a
financial and a social point of view.
In addition to our annual environmental
reporting, we began working systematically with other aspects of CSR in 2009. This
work is concentrated on the environment,
our employees and our suppliers, but we
also include other areas of significance
to our business and have defined an additional two areas of focus: business ethics

and products. As a result, we now have
five focus areas, all wholly or partly related
to the three main elements of our CSR
work: people (social relationships), planet
(the environment) and profit (finances),
as shown in the figure below. The figure
below also shows how our policies and
other specific initiatives cover the three
main elements.

Our CSR goals are driven by the Company's
general strategy of creating a profitable
business; many of the specific targets
stated in this report are derived directly
from activities that support our general
strategic goals. We are constantly working
to identify areas that are crucial to the
Company's business and also have or could
have a positive impact on performance in
working towards to the CSR targets set.
The model is explained in greater detail
in the section of this report entitled "CSR
elements".
In addition to a general CSR policy, we
have policies in the areas we believe are
essential to our work. These policies are a
natural extension of the various objectives
we work towards as a company, whose
purpose is to create commercial value for
the Company. We do not as yet have an
actual suppliers policy, but have instead incorporated these elements into our general
CSR policy. Neither do we have a policy for
human rights, but we are aware of the UN
Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights, which we will investigate further in
relation to our business.
We also have a number of other elements
to support the Company's CSR work. A
general overview of the most important of

these elements appears at the end of this
report, in the section "CSR elements".
About the report
This CSR report was prepared in accordance
with the Danish Financial Statements Act
requirements with respect to CSR reporting.
The report covers the financial year January
1 to December 31, 2013, and forms part of
the management's review in the annual report as signed and approved by the Board
of Directors and Corporate Management on
March 19, 2014.
Reporting principles
This CSR report was prepared with inspiration from the Global Reporting Initiative
(GRI), a recognized framework for sustainability reporting. The GRI structure includes
principles and indicators we use to measure and explain the Company’s financial,
environmental and social performance.
We selected the areas to be reported on
based on a principle of materiality: we
endeavored to include the most important
ways in which the Company has either a
direct or an indirect impact on the world
around it. Our production facilities are one
of the chief sources of our impact on the
environment, and we seek to provide a
high degree of transparency by calculating
our carbon footprint and reporting environmental data.

Scope of the report
In our CSR report, we focus on our largest
facilities: i.e. Kvistgaard (industrial production, quality control laboratories, technical
services department and administration),
Martinsried (research and development),
Berlin (production of clinical trial materials)
and Mountain View, California (research
and development). Taken together, these
facilities employ more than 99% of the
Group's staff and are responsible for the
greatest share by far of the energy and raw
materials consumed by the Group.
As part of our efforts to optimize our
production competencies, we closed our
Berlin facility in 2013 and transferred its
operations to Kvistgaard. As a certain level
of activity was maintained at the Berlin
facility in the first six months of 2013, we
have elected to include the 2013 data from
Berlin in this report.
The scope of this report has not been expanded compared with our 2012 report.

Policies
Bavarian Nordic develops and manufactures vaccines for the prevention and treatment of
life-threatening diseases where there are as yet unmet needs. In doing so, we seek to create
a continuing business that will ensure the Company’s growth and investment in research and
development and thus continue to contribute to a healthier and safer society.
At the same time, we focus on working
and acting responsibly with respect to the
world we live in. We aim to do this by
•	 manufacturing high-quality vaccines.
•	 working actively and systematically to
minimize our impact on the environment and climate.

that viruses do not escape into the indoor
or outdoor environment through the air,
in our waste or in our wastewater. At
Bavarian Nordic, we continually work to
improve our environmental and climate
performance. Our aims are
•	 to encourage environmentally aware
behavior and prevent contamination
and pollution throughout the Company.

•	 maintaining an active dialog with our
stakeholders on a local, national and
global level.

•	 to reduce our environmental and climate impact impact by

•	 actively supporting and respecting human rights and labor standards.

	 – developing and using processes with
a minimum of environmental impact.

•	 providing a safe and healthy working
environment for our staff that includes
opportunities for professional and personal development.

	 – optimizing our utilization of materials
and energy.

•	 communicating our CSR policy to external collaboration partners, including our
suppliers.

•	 to comply with environmental protection regulations and relevant requirements.

Environmental and climate policy
At Bavarian Nordic, we design our vaccine
production facilities and procedures so

•	 to gradually build an environmental
management system based on the
principles in the ISO 14001 standard.

	 – reducing emissions and waste.

Health and safety policy
A safe and healthy working environment
is vital to employee safety and satisfaction at the workplace. We focus on
systematically mapping both the physical
and mental working environment so that
the necessary preventive steps can be
taken, for the benefit of both individual
employees and the Company as a whole.
The aims of our general health and safety
policy are
•	 to promote awareness of health- and
safety-related behavior in all employees
as part of their day-to-day work and to
produce proactive solutions to potential
problems.
•	 to gradually develop an environmental
health and safety management system
to support this proactive safety work.

Products
Bavarian Nordic helps make the world healthier, safer and more secure through our
development and production of innovative vaccines and immunotherapies for the prevention
and treatment of life-threatening diseases.
Research into and development of new
products requires substantial investment,
so a precondition for this work is the
ability to create a lasting and profitable
business.
Through contracts with the U.S. government, we have successfully developed
a new smallpox vaccine that we manufacture for the U.S. Strategic National
Stockpile, and this has laid the necessary
foundation for the further development of
our business and new products to benefit
patients in the future.
Product safety is crucial in our business,
and quality and responsibility are important elements of our corporate culture.
Drug development is already one of the
most regulated areas, in which a strong
regulatory regime of inspections and approvals sets a high standard for all areas
of our disciplines.
IMVANEX® smallpox vaccine
Our IMVANEX smallpox vaccine was approved in the European Union in August
2013 and in Canada in November 2013
(under the name of IMVAMUNE). We
have manufactured the vaccine at our
Kvistgaard facility for a number of years
and supplied it to various governments.
Although we only obtained marketing

1

Good Manufacturing Practice

authorizations for the vaccine in 2013,
certain countries have prioritised having a
stockpile of the vaccine for potential use
as part of their biological preparedness in
persons who do not tolerate the traditional smallpox vaccines well.
Our primary customer is the U.S. government, which ordered 20 million doses in
2007 for delivery in 2010-2013. The U.S.
government placed a new order in April
2013, which runs into 2014.
The IMVANEX vaccine is based on a live
attenuated virus, so it cannot be heat
sterilized because that would destroy the
active ingredient in the vaccine. For this
reason, a scrupulous quality control and
hygiene assurance has been built into
the entire process. The pharmaceutical
industry works according to GMP2). GMP
includes strict requirements with respect
to a product’s traceability, strength, quality and purity, which means that quality
management is built into each step of the
manufacturing process. GMP rules are laid
down by the Danish, European and U.S.
health authorities.
Bavarian Nordic supplies these markets
and thus complies with these quality
requirements.

PROSTVAC® – prostate cancer
immunotherapy
PROSTVAC is our leading cancer project
in final Phase 3 development. PROSTVAC
belongs to a new class of treatment:
immunotherapy aimed at training the
patient's own immune system to fight
cancer. In an earlier large-scale Phase 2
clinical study, the vaccine demonstrated
an increased median survival time of
8.5 months for patients with advanced
prostate cancer. These results are among
the best ever demonstrated in this patient
group, and they have led to the start-up
of a global Phase 3 clinical study in 1200
patients with metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer.
We intend to apply for a marketing
authorization for PROSTVAC once positive
data from the study are available. We
have already begun preliminary activities
with a view to a market launch, including preparations for manufacturing the
vaccine at our Kvistgaard facility, where
the construction of a new production unit
began in 2013 after we received environmental approval in June.

CsR rEport 2013

Environment and Climate
Most of Bavarian Nordic's impact on the environment and climate comes from our production,
so we pay particular attention to improving efficiency and our manufacturing processes in order
to optimize our use of resources.
When we built our factory in the Danish town of Kvistgaard in 2005, we had
a great deal of focus on the factory's
environmental impact. Since then, we
have continually worked to minimize our
environmental impact, and we continue
to work actively with environmental,
health and safety planning in new building projects as well, also in connection
with the construction of the new building
in which PROSTVAC will be manufactured.
The new features of the building will
include recirculation of air to save on
energy consumption, as approved by the
Danish Working Environment Authority.
In connection with recent years' expansion of the facility and its production, we
have also paid particular attention to our
impact on the community, making an
effort to remain in communication with
our neighbors, especially with respect
to noise, which is what may affect them
most directly.
In 2013, we exceeded the noise limits
on a single reference point in connection with the installation of new cooling
containers. However, we received no
complaints from our neighbors or others,
so we applied for these restrictions to be
eased pursuant to Danish law in 2012. In
March 2013, the Danish Environmental
Protection Agency turned down our application for the noise limits to be eased, so
we have begun installing a noise screen

to limit the noise. We subsequently made
a new measurement of noise throughout
the facility, which was documented in
a report issued in November 2013. The
report contains an updated calculation of
noise conditions around the facility. The
noise exposure has been determined at
all reference points and shows that the
noise exposure is lower than the noise
limits set during all day and night periods.
A wastewater test measurement in
December 2012 showed that it exceeded
permitted pH and chloride content levels.
An investigation was launched, and a
slightly elevated content of chloride
was found, probably due to road salt.
No cause of the elevated pH level was
identified. A test measurement in October
2013 showed that all parameters were in
compliance.
The environmental protection authorities have categorized Bavarian Nordic
as a Level 1 company, i.e. they deem
the Company to be at the forefront of
environmental work. This is reflected in a
high degree of compliance and systematization. The environmental authorities
no longer categorize companies, but it
is Bavarian Nordic's goal to remain at a
high level in its environmental work, also
as we await a new initiative from the
environmental authorities in the course
of 2014.

In 2013, we maintained our low 2012
level of relative climate impact, which
was achieved as we continued to work
towards a more efficient utilization of our
production facilities. We will continue to
focus on opportunities to reduce our relative climate impact.
In late 2012, we installed a new energy
monitoring system at our Kvistgaard
facility to collect data and track our use of
energy and water. The new system allows
us to identify inappropriate consumption
and thus make improvements. In 2013,
we had the opportunity to analyse our
consumption figures, and we will continue
to do so in 2013 in order to define future
reduction targets.
Moreover, we will be conducting an
energy screening of our entire Kvistgaard
facility in 2014 to find out how and where
we can optimize our energy consumption.
We will conduct the energy screening,
when we have selected an external service provider to so.
Bavarian Nordic's environmental permit
from September 7, 2004, is up for reassessment, so we prepared a new, updated
environmental technical description in
late 2013. Against this backdrop, the
environmental authorities will conduct a
reassessment – also looking at the limits
set – sometime in 2014. The purpose of
the update is to incorporate the changes
that have occurred since 2004, including
an environmental approval of the manufacture of PROSTVAC from June 2013.

Employees
Bavarian Nordic has in recent years moved from being a purely research-based business to also
encompassing in-house production and quality control.
These are areas in which many different
staff groups work together, and the rapid
growth we have seen has made it essential for us to establish a shared identity
and culture for the Company and its employees. For this reason, we defined a set
of corporate values in 2011 and worked to
anchor them throughout the organization
over the past few years.
As an example, the corporate values
are an integral part of both our annual
employee performance reviews and job
interviews when we recruit new employees. In addition, we have begun offering
a management development course in
which our corporate values also play a
key role.
We have also established an HR forum
with representatives from the HR functions in all our countries of operation: its
purpose is to ensure overall coordination of management initiatives and to
establish best practices for this field. The
forum has defined common goals for our
work with the corporate values, and in
2014 we will focus on strengthening our
internal communications throughout the
organisation.
Diversity
As a global organisation, we are used to
collaborating across national borders and
cultures. We support a diverse, accommodating and non-discriminatory working
environment without looking at gender,
age, ethnicity, physical impairment, religion or sexual orientation, and we believe
this helps create business value in the
Company.
Our Board of Directors discusses the
Company's activities every year in order
to ensure that the greatest possible

competencies exist at all management
levels. Our managers and executives are
selected exclusively on the basis of their
qualifications and not on gender. This
ensures that we can provide equal opportunities to both sexes if candidates for the
positions have the required professional
background.
The Board of Directors is our supreme
governing body and consists of six
shareholder-elected members. In 2013, all
members of the Board of Directors were
men, so the Board set a target for representation of the under-represented gender: 15%, equivalent to one person, and
the target must be met in 2017 at the latest. The target was set taking into account
the composition of the current Board of
Directors and the boards of directors of
our peer companies, but also considered
ensuring continuity on the Board of Directors, which is why the target is considered
to be both realistic and ambitious.
There was no under-representation of
men or women among other executive
or management staff of Bavarian Nordic
at year-end 2013. We will determine the
share of male and female managers and
executives every year to ensure compliance with statutory requirements. (See
also Table 2.)
Training and upgrading of
employee qualifications
We are an innovative, knowledge-based
company, and it is important for us to attract and retain highly qualified workers.
Also for this reason, we want to offer our
staff a good working environment that
also provides them with development opportunities. There are good opportunities
at Bavarian Nordic, both for development
within a field of work by rotation between

production, laboratory and office jobs,
or for development vertically within the
management hierarchy. As a result, we
are happy to recruit internally, and we focus on staff development potential in our
annual employee performance reviews.
It is crucial that our employees have
the necessary tools and techniques to
perform well in their jobs now and in
the future. Our goal is, as a minimum,
for our workers and managers to always
have the skills to look for and find their
own job. For this reason, we focus on
continuing training and education and on
upgrading qualifications, also those of the
many employees who work in the GMP
areas. Furthermore, we have allocated
additional funds for training, and more
employees have taken external courses. A
few have begun taking classes in training
or educational programs while continuing
to work at Bavarian Nordic. In 2013, the
first employees at our Kvistgaard facility
completed training as plant operators, and
several new participants have enrolled.
We also regularly hire trainees, also
graduate work experience trainees, contributing to the effort to ensure that university students obtain the competencies
required in business and industry. We also
want to be able to offer relevant student
jobs to university students. In addition,
representatives from Bavarian Nordic
regularly hold presentations at a number
of colleges and universities as part of the
programs offered by those institutions.
Leadership
In step with our growth as a company,
requirements with respect to a visible and
competent leadership have also grown,
and in recent years we have had a special
focus on training managers and execu-

CsR rEport 2013

12

tives at all levels. In 2013, we completed a
specially designed management development course for all managers and executives of the Group.
Employee health and job satisfaction
At Bavarian Nordic, we strive towards
a good, healthy work-life balance, and
at work we focus on employee health
and job satisfaction. We do so in a close
dialogue between management and employees through a number of established
committees, including a works council and
a health and safety committee on which
both management and employees are
represented and regularly discuss matters
that may have an impact on the wellbeing and jobs of our employees. All staff
at Kvistgaard are included in our corporate
health insurance plan, which ensures
fast and professional help and treatment
at private hospitals and from psychologists, chiropractors, physiotherapists, etc.,
should the need arise.
We work actively to counteract stress. We
have a focus on stress indicators in daily

Absence
We have been working actively for several
years on dialog-based sickness absence
management, ahead of legislative trends.
We generally achieve a quicker return to
work by handling each case individually,
also including an option to return to work
part-time or be assigned other tasks at
first. The goal is to reduce the percentage of long-term absence that is due
to sickness, which has accounted for a
substantial share of all sickness absence
in recent years.

ish law. Moreover, we regularly conduct
workplace assessments when observations or changes in working procedures
indicate there is a need to do so. Based
on the workplace assessments, relevant
improvement initiatives are put forward,
prioritized and translated into action
in the various departments. In compliance with Danish regulations, employee
representatives and managers have been
elected to health and safety groups and a
health and safety committee at Kvistgaard. The health and safety committee
meets every quarter to follow up on the
action plan in order improve working
conditions and safety.

A good, safe working environment
The Company’s occupational health and
safety work is different at our different
sites to comply with the different countries’ regulatory requirements. We will
survey working environment conditions
at our Kvistgaard facility going forward by
conducting workplace assessments every
second year, which is more frequent than
the every three years required by Dan-

To further improve our health and safety
work, we hired an EHS specialist at Kvistgaard in 2013 (Environment, Health and
Safety) to provide support in our health
and safety work and to coordinate measures concerning health and safety, the

In 2013, an increase was recorded in the
number of occupational accidents with
more than one day of resulting absence,
which also caused an increase in our accident rate, although this rate is still lower
than the average accident rate for Danish
companies.
At Kvistgaard, where most of the Company's employees work, three occupational
accidents were reported in 2013, and six
were reported in Germany. The accidents
were minor ones, causing an average of

Work-related accidents

1.3 days of absence. We are very much
focusing on reversing this trend by thoroughly investigating the accident causes
in order to prevent similar accidents in
future. As part of our preventive work, we
have also introduced reporting of nearevents that could have led to an accident.

We encourage innovative thinking that
promotes beneficial change for both the
individual and the Company.

Suppliers
As an integral part of Bavarian Nordic's CSR policy, we wish to maintain an active dialog with
our suppliers about social responsibility and environmental initiatives.
When setting up our production, we
mapped out the geographical locations
of our raw materials suppliers and found
that they are mainly located in North
America and the EU, which already have
a high level of regulation of social and
environmental parameters. Also, new
potential suppliers are evaluated with
respect to their geographical location
and thus the risk they represent, and an
assessment is made as to whether action
is necessary.
In contracts with our suppliers, we inform
them of our business ethics and our expectations that our suppliers comply with
basic ethical, social and environmental
guidelines.

In accordance with both Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and our own supplier
management system currently in place,
all our new raw materials suppliers are
audited. Following the initial audit, suppliers are evaluated every third year as
a minimum, either by way of a visit or a
questionnaire, depending on the situation.
The audits do not include CSR-related
issues, but they provide an excellent opportunity to talk with the suppliers about
their attitudes and practices in the area
and also to comment on any problematic
issues.

Business Ethics
Bavarian Nordic prioritizes business ethics as a natural part of its underlying business concept.
We want to be seen as credible and reliable in the eyes of our collaboration partners and the
rest of the world around us.
We have developed a Code of Ethics and
Business Conduct that must be observed
by everyone in the Company. Management is obliged to take violations of the
code seriously.
The Code of Ethics and Business Conduct
contains rules within a large number of
areas, including
•	 Compliance with laws and regulations

The Code also includes the rules and regulations in the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (FCPA) and the Truth in Negotiations
Act (TINA) that are relevant in connection
with the Company's business transactions
and negotiations in the United States.
The Company is otherwise committed to
cooperating in connection with investigations organized by authorized individuals
working on behalf of authorities with
legitimate rights.

•	 Conflicts of interest
•	 Gifts, free services and entertainment
•	 Corrupt practices

Ethics hotline in 2014
The Company's management has decided
to introduce an ethics hotline to give
employees the opportunity to report
possible violations of the Code. A special
work group reporting to the management

has been looking at the practical aspects
of such a hotline, which will be set up in
collaboration with a third-party service
provider, partly to protect the employees who raise concerns, and partly to
ensure that the necessary investigations
are conducted when a concern has been
raised, and that corrective action is taken
if necessary.
Because the ethics hotline may involve
reporting personally sensitive data, it
must be pre-approved by the Danish Data
Protection Agency. We filed an application
with the Agency in 2012 that the Agency
took longer than expected to process, so
we expect to have the hotline up and running sometime in the first half of 2014.

Independent auditor’s report on key
performance indicators
To the Executive Board of
Bavarian Nordic A/S
We have reviewed the key performance indicators for 2013 in
Tables 1 to 6 in Bavarian Nordic A/S’ 2013 CSR report for the purpose of issuing an auditor’s report in this respect.
The Company’s Management is responsible for the CSR report.
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the key performance indicators in the CSR report based on our review.
Scope of work
We conducted our work in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing governing Other Assurance Engagements
and additional requirements under Danish audit regulation to
obtain limited assurance about our conclusion. We have obtained
limited assurance because, compared to a reasonable assurance
engagement, our work has been limited primarily to inquiries of
company personnel and analytical procedures.

The purpose has been to obtain limited assurance that the data
presented in the CSR report are in accordance with the described
reporting practice and the information submitted by the reporting units included.
Our work is based on an assessment of risk of material misstatements. The work consists primarily of inquiries of company
personnel and of applying analytical procedures.
We believe that the work conducted provides a reasonable basis
for our conclusion.
Conclusion
Based on our work, nothing has come to our attention that
causes us to believe that the key performance indicators in
Tables 1 to 6 in the CSR report for 2013 are not in accordance with
the reporting practice described and the information reported by
the production sites.

* In recent years, Bavarian Nordic has focused on production optimization, and this has resulted in substantial improvements in the use of resources and energy per
manufactured dose. For this reason, we elected to present our climate impact as an index figure reflecting the relative energy consumption per manufactured dose.

Our total CO2 emissions were down by 9% year on year, which
was mainly due to a lower level of manufacturing activity.
Our manufacturing efficiency improved again in 2013 as a result
of a continuing focus on process efficiencies and utilization of
resources; we also reduced our power consumption, with the
effect that relative emissions per manufactured dose remained
under index 100.

The Kvistgaard facility, where our industrial production and many
of our laboratory activities take place, is also the facility that
contributes most to our total carbon footprint. The largest source
of CO2 emissions is the facility's use of electrical power, followed
by natural gas for heating. The power is used to run ventilation
systems, a refrigeration compressor, process equipment, refrigerators, freezers, air compressors, office equipment and lighting;
the natural gas is used for heating and steam production.

The comparative figure for 2012 has been restated.

Our headcount was down by 5% in 2013, a decline mainly due
to the closure of our facility in Berlin, which took place over the
course of the year as part of our efforts to increase production efficiency. The activities from Berlin were transferred to Kvistgaard.
The decline was partly offset by the continuing expansion of our
R&D department in Mountain View, primarily as a result of the
Phase 3 study for PROSTVAC.
The rate of employee turnover was 19.6% (2012: 13.7%), an
increase primarily due to the outflow of employees from Berlin.

The absence rate was 3.9% in 2013, which was lower than
in 2012. The absence rate includes employees at Kvistgaard,
Martinsried and Berlin. The absence rate for Kvistgaard was 3.5%
(2012: 3.5%), while the combined rate for Martinsried and Berlin
was 4.8% (2012: 5.7%), an improvement mainly due to a lower
percentage of long-term absence.
In 2013, there were nine occupational accidents, the highest
number since 2009, although they were minor accidents causing
an average of 1.3 days of absence. The accident rate remains
below that of other companies, and it is our goal to continue
reducing the rate through proactive measures in the field of
occupational health and safety.

Chicken eggs are used in the production process, inoculated
with MVA-BN® to produce the active ingredient of the vaccine.
Ready-mixed media (nutrients) are used to culture the biological agents, along with ready-made saline solutions to purify the
active ingredient. Disinfectants are used together with acidic and
alkaline solutions to clean systems and equipment and adjust
the pH of the wastewater before discharging it into the municipal
sewer system. Disinfectants are also used to disinfect the eggs

before further processing. Glycol is used in the cooling/refrigeration systems, along with small amounts of corrosion inhibitors in
the production of steam.
For most parameters, raw materials consumption was below the
2012 level, because fewer batches were produced in 2013 than in
2012.

Process wastewater is heat-inactivated, cooled and pH adjusted
before being discharged into the public sewer system. Inactivation is a procedure that ensures that all virus remnants are rendered 100% harmless, and the system is checked for operational

problems before discharge. This treatment ensures that the
discharged wastewater complies with the requirements in the
Company's permit to use the municipal sewer system, which was
issued in October 2004.

In March 2013, Bavarian Nordic received a noise limits enforcement notice from the Danish Environmental Protection Agency,
which at the same time rejected the company's application for
the noise limit to be raised at a single reference point at our
Kvistgaard facility. Against this backdrop, we prepared and implemented an action plan to reduce noise, with the result that we
now comply with the noise limits as documented in our November 2013 report titled Miljømåling Ekstern Støj ("Environmental
measurement, external noise").

Reporting Principles
The basic data for this report covers the
entities stated in the table below. All data
for resource and raw materials consumption in the manufacture of finished
products refers only to the production
facility at Kvistgaard. The facility in Berlin
was closed by the end of June 2013, so
data from there only refers to the first six
months of the year. Data was gathered
to the extent it was accessible within the
boundaries of our existing systems.

Carbon footprint
Our carbon footprint calculations are
based on the standard from and recommendations of the Greenhouse Gas
Protocol Initiative for calculating an
organization’s total carbon emissions,
which include the six greenhouse gasses
addressed by the Kyoto Protocol – CO2,CH4,
N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6 – calculated in
metric tons of CO2 equivalents. Emissions
sources are divided into three scopes:
direct emissions from activities under the
Company’s control (Scope 1), emissions
from the consumption of electrical power
(Scope 2) and indirect emissions from
products and services (Scope 3). According
to the recommendations, organizations
should report on Scope 1 and Scope 2 as
a minimum, and this is what we have
decided to do in our carbon footprint
statement.
We have calculated the total carbon
emissions from our locations in Kvistgaard, Martinsried, Berlin and Mountain
View. In 2013, we also included the power
and heating consumption at our leased
laboratories in Hørsholm. Berlin was only
in operation during the first six months
of the year. As no consumption data are
available from that location, we estimated
the figures based on average consumption during the preceding three years.

Kvistgaard includes a small leased laboratory facility in Hørsholm: the carbon footprint for this facility is
calculated separately and included in total emissions, but is not included in emissions for Kvistgaard, cf.
Table 1.

For other sites, the calculations include
the following four different types of emissions:
Natural gas and oil
This figure is based primarily on current
consumption as measured by monthly
meter readings. Oil used for emergency
generators is estimated or based on oil
purchased. Greenhouse gas emissions
from the combustion of fossil fuels are
calculated on the basis of an average
emission factor.
Fugitive emissions
Fugitive emissions include CO2 from the
use of dry ice and CO2 gas plus emissions
of greenhouse gasses from cooling and
refrigeration systems.
Electricity
Electrical power consumption is based on
meter readings recorded at the end of the
year. The calculation of greenhouse gas
emissions from electrical power consumption is based on specific emission factors
provided by the power company and an
average emission factor for generation of
power in Germany.
Mileage (in km)
This figure is calculated on the basis of
receipts from gasoline companies and in-

cludes motor vehicles owned or leased by
the Company. Greenhouse gas emissions
are calculated on the basis of an average
fuel-specific emission factor for ordinary
cars in Denmark and Germany.
Emission factors
In calculating CO2 emissions, specific
emission factors based on emissions type
and geographic location were used. CO2
emissions from the combustion of natural
gas, oil, gasoline, diesel fuel and LPG and
from fugitive emissions were deemed to
have a general global effect with minor
local differences. Emission factors from
these sources are based on data provided
by the Danish Energy Agency.
However, natural gas emission factors for
Mountain View are based on figures from
The Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a
provider of natural gas and electricity in
California.
Emissions for locally purchased electricity were determined on the basis of local
conditions. Emission factors for Kvistgaard
are based on factors for Denmark as a
whole. Emission calculations for electrical
power at Mountain View are based on
emission factors provided by The Pacific
Gas and Electric Company. Emission calculations for electrical power purchased in

Germany are based on general German
emission factors; emission calculations for
district heating purchased in Germany are
based on emission factors published by
local district heating companies.

Employee turnover
Employee turnover is calculated as the
number of employees that left their jobs
divided by the average number of employees over the course of the year.

Indexed CO2 emissions
per dose produced.
CO2 emissions per manufactured dose are
indexed to 2009 and calculated on the
basis of the number of batches manufactured, translated into the projected
number of doses manufactured during the
calendar year.

Accidents
Work-related accident data relates to accidents resulting in more than one day of
absence. The definition of "work-related
accident" in Danish law is the definition
applicable in this document. The accident
rate is the number of occupational accidents per one million working hours;
vacation days are not included.

Employees
Absence
Absence data includes recorded staff sick
days and child sick days. Leave – also
maternity and paternity leave – is not
included in these figures. The absence
rate was calculated by dividing the total
number of days of absence by the product
of the average number of full-time employees for the year and the number of
work days in the calendar year.

Raw and ancillary materials

Water
Water consumption is calculated for
the entire Kvistgaard facility, including
laboratories and administrative functions.
An analysis of wastewater is made once
a year. The figures in Table 4 for phosphorous, nitrogen, carbon and chlorides are
based on these measurements.

Waste
Waste volumes are calculated based on
annual statements from approved waste
carriers handling ordinary and hazardous
waste.

Raw materials for production are calculated based on the Company's inventory
system (ERP system), and figures refer to
consumption for the year. Ancillary materials (acids/bases, salt and refrigerants)
are materials sourced during the year, and
figures are based on invoiced purchases.
