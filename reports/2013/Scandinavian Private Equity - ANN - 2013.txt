stAtutory stAtement on corporAte socIAl responsIbIlItyPoliCySPEAS believes there is a positive connection between acompany’s long-term success and its compliance with aswell as ongoing adaptation to ethical and environmentalmarket norms. Thus the private equity funds’ policiesregarding responsible investment form an integratedpart of the investment process, including whether theindividual private equity fund has adopted any recognisedcode of practice or equivalent in the area.SPEAS has only indirect influence on the individual privateequity funds’ choice of companies in which to invest,however, the Company’s basic premise is that companiescomply with laws and rules determined by national authoritieson the markets in which the company operatesas well as with internationally adopted norms concerninghuman rights and labour standards.iMPleMentationIn cooperation with the management company, SPEASassesses (i) whether the private equity company hasadopted a code of practice or equivalent regarding responsibleinvestment, (ii) to which extent the private equitycompany considers other relevant ethical and environmentalissues prior to making an investment, (iii) howrelevant ethical and environmental issues are addressedby the portfolio companies during the holding period,and (iv) the ongoing reporting to the investors regardingstatus and development of same.If a private equity company has not adopted any recognisedcode of practice regarding responsible investmentor implemented a satisfactory policy in this regard, SPEASand the management company will enter into a dialoguewith the private equity company with a view to includingrelevant ethical and environmental issues in the investmentprocess.resultsOn all investment commitments made within the lasttwo financial years, SPEAS has received declarationsof intent from the private equity funds in question tointegrate codes of practice for responsible investment intotheir investment processes and implement these in theirportfolio companies. In our dialogue with the privateequity funds and in ongoing reporting, SPEAS has not recognisedany breach of these commitments. As SPEAS doesnot invest directly in portfolio companies, but only wieldsindirect influence through the private equity funds, wedo not find it possible to evaluate any further the resultsachieved or any expectations to future achievement.
