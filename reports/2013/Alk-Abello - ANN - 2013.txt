Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

As an international pharmaceutical
company, ALK has an important social
responsibility. ALK strives to live up to this
responsibility and be recognised by its
stakeholders as a reliable and responsible
company characterised by professionalism, honesty and integrity.
ALK’s policy for social responsibility is
focused on the four areas below:

1. Prevention, diagnosis and
treatment of allergy
ALK is the world leader in allergy immunotherapy. ALK therefore has a particular
responsibility and is strongly committed
in its efforts to fight allergy. ALK makes
its knowledge and resources available to
promote the prevention, diagnosis and
treatment of allergy. ALK cooperates with
all relevant stakeholders to fight allergy,
including the public authorities and private
and public institutions, as well as NGOs.
A special focus area of ALK’s social commitment is children suffering from allergy,
including their risk of developing asthma.
In 2013, ALK sponsored a project to
raise awareness on respiratory allergy
undertaken by the European Federation
of Allergy and Airways Diseases Patients’
Associations (EFA). The sponsorship was
initiated in 2012. Within the framework of
this sponsorship EFA has published a ‘Call
to Action’, encouraging European politicians and other decision makers to ensure
improvements of prevention, diagnosis
and treatment of allergy. As part of ALK’s
activities during the annual European
Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) congress, ALK promoted
the Call to Action issued by EFA. During the
congress, EFA furthermore presented the
results of an Austrian pilot project investigating if pharmacies can play an active
role in diagnosis of allergy. This project
was also supported by the ALK sponsorship to EFA.

In 2013, ALK’s affiliates, in cooperation with patient associations, medical
societies and authorities, have also
undertaken other activities to increase
awareness of allergy and patients’ access to treatment and to make relevant
information available to patients and their
relatives.

to be adjusted due to these changes and
expansions. By end of 2013, it was not yet
possible to calculate and adjust for the
changes according to the guidelines from
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Data are
therefore missing in the table Non-financial key figures. The energy consumption
in real terms has increased by 8%.

The cooperation with EFA, EAACI and the
local activities will also continue in 2014.

A number of energy-saving projects were
implemented in 2013. Examples are
ventilation improvements, new roof coating decreasing building temperature and
improvement of a cooling system.

2. Production/environment
ALK works systematically to improve
working environment and environmental
conditions in every area of the company,
supported by the local SHE (Safety, Health,
Environment) organisations at all production sites. ALK has been environmentally
certified (ISO 14001) in Denmark since
2007 and was recertified for another three
years in 2013. The other production sites
in Spain, France, the Netherlands, the USA
and Canada adhere to the SHE standards.
In 2009, the Management adopted global
long-term goals for the SHE-related activities focusing on the reduction of energy
consumption, including CO² emissions.
The objective is that absolute energy consumption in 2014 will not have increased
compared to the consumption in 2008¹
while CO² emissions will have decreased
by at least 15%.
In 2013, ALK in Denmark has converted
more than half of the electricity consumption (about 20% of the total energy consumption) to come from a CO² neutral energy source – power from wind turbines²
– thereby reducing the CO² emission with
more than 1,000 tonnes.
Production changes in the USA and building activities in France in 2013 have a
significant impact on the energy consumption. To make the energy consumption
comparable, baseline (year 2008) has

In 2013, ALK received no complaints and
experienced no unintended spills. Specific
waste water contents exceed the limits
at one site where ALK is in close dialogue
with the local authorities and action will be
taken. All other legislative requirements
are in compliance.

3. Ethical conduct
In 2009, ALK launched its ALK Code of Conduct in order to support professionalism,
honesty and integrity throughout the company and in relation with customers, employees, shareholders, society, suppliers
and partners. All employees are required
to adhere to ALK’s Code of Conduct.
ALK's commitment to managing human
rights in our business is contained in
the ALK Code of Conduct. In the Code of
Conduct we describe the requirements
we have established for our actions and
behaviours. We support the UN Global
Compact’s 10 principles, not least in the
areas of human and labour rights, the
environment and anti-corruption and we
have integrated these principles in the ALK
Code of Conduct. To see ALK’s Code of Conduct please visit http://www.alk-abello.
com/aboutalk/csr/businessethics/
Pages/home.aspx.

¹ Consumption and emissions in 2008 will be adjusted in terms of establishment of new production sites, closure of old production sites, acquisitions, etc., in line with guidelines
prepared in accordance with the principles of the Global Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
² ALK has in 2013 bought RECS-certificates (Renewable Energy Certificate System) equivalent to 3,479 MWh.

In 2013, the ALK Code of Conduct was
updated. The updated version will be
launched in 2014.
In September 2013, ALK launched a
whistleblower scheme, ALK Alertline,
giving employees with knowledge of potentially destructive or illegal acts related
to ALK’s activities the opportunity to report
their observations. The scheme minimises the risk of illegalities and irregularities within the areas of financial crime,
environmental pollution or inappropriate
conduct, as well as other circumstances
that may be to the detriment of ALK.
No reports have been filed through the ALK
Alertline in 2013.

4. Employees
ALK employs 1763 employees, of whom
672 are employed in Denmark. ALK wishes
to continue to be an attractive workplace
that can attract and retain the competent, well-functioning and committed
employees who are ALK’s most important
resource. To obtain this ALK works systematically to improve safety and the working
environment, including the psychosocial
working environment, and to develop an
organisation, culture and management
that encourage professional and personal
development. In this way we also ensure
that the human rights of our employees
are respected.

Safety
In ALK we have a long tradition of working
systematically to improve working environment and conditions.
ALK in Denmark has been health and
safety certified (OHSAS 18001) since
2007 and in 2013, ALK was recertified for
another three years.
In 2009, Management adopted global and
long-term goals for the improvement of
safety and well-being at work. The goal is
to reduce the number of absence days per
employee due to incidents at work on a
continuous basis.
In 2013, the number of days of absence
due to work-related injuries decreased
to 0.053 days per employee, which is a
reduction of 21% compared to the average
for the preceding three years.
Organisation, culture and management
Over the past four years, ALK has worked
to establish a performance culture. To
further strengthen the ability to execute
the strategy and to support a uniform
performance management process, a

new IT tool PerformIT was introduced in
2013. This tool documents for all employees what they are accountable for, how
they are performing and what they should
develop to improve even more.
In spring 2013, the integrated Engagement and Leadership Survey was run with
a response rate of 91%. The results of
the survey have been discussed throughout the organisation in order to further
improve and promote the positive and
productive working environment.
In addition, ALK reviews the organisation
on an annual basis to determine whether
the structure, resources and competences
are fit to reach the strategic goals.
Diversity
ALK seeks diversity as one of the prerequisites for the company’s success and
this naturally includes equal opportunities
for men and women to pursue a management career in ALK.
At present, there are no women on the
Board of Directors elected by the general
meeting. ALK aims for a gender represen-

tation of one or two women out of the six
members elected by the general meeting.
The goal is to be met by 2017.
Presently, there are no women on the
Board of Management while there are
three women among the 25 functional
managers. However, among first-line
managers and mid-level managers the
share of women is considerably higher.
The share of women is 34% among midlevel managers and 51% among first-line
managers, including e.g. R&D team leaders. Overall, women account for 43% of the
managers employed with ALK.
In 2014, ALK will continue its efforts and
commitment towards equal opportunities
for women and men at all management
levels.

One way to ensure this is to consider both
male and female candidates in connection with internal and external executive
recruitment and that at least one candidate
from the under-represented sex is on the
short list when recruiting for management
positions. Furthermore, it will be ensured
that both women and men are part of ALK’s
talent pools for management positions.
ALK wishes to have more attention to
women’s career progression and development and will offer female managers
participation in networks or mentoring
schemes.
When conducting the yearly Organisational Review, ALK will have increased focus
on monitoring the share of women at all
management levels.
