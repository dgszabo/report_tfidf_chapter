Management’s report

The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) work is a natural part
of the Group’s work. To Gabriel, CSR means that the company
takes responsibility for adding value which contributes directly
and indirectly to a positive development in society. The company
endorses the principles specified in the UN Global Compact and
puts a determined effort into the company’s CSR and environmental policies and activities.
Being a responsible company is central to the way Gabriel is run
and is a permanent point on the strategic agenda. CSR is not a
transient fashion but a strategic driver on a par with product development, sales and other activities. Gabriel assumes an extraordinary responsibility for how products are produced, including
in those areas where the group is not the owner.
Gabriel’s environmental work is seen as a part of CSR. This report
deals with both perspectives and it is based on the matters judged
to be most important. The purpose of the report is to share information on Gabriel’s CSR and environmental work with the
company’s stakeholders. It is the ambition to share knowledge
on the company’s affairs and to commit to continuous improvements by communicating goals, activities and achieved results
to the public.

Gabriel played an active role in the development of the next generation EU Ecolabel to ensure widespread use of the label. In addition, the company was involved in a number of national projects
focusing on product life cycle and closed-loop resource cycles.
The CSR strategy is developed continuously internally and it is
increasingly implemented in close partnership with the company’s
main customers, where strong emphasis is also attached to weighing the products’ CSR and environmental impacts.
In the detailed perspective, an increasing focus on the products’
chemical content is seen as new demands regarding chemicals
emerge regularly from customers and the public in general.
Gabriel supports these new points of attention and finds that
the years of environmental work make it a manageable task to
handle these new requirements and thus make it easy for the
customer to choose the best alternative.
The following pages describe the company’s objective, specific
policies in the CSR and environmental area, concrete effects of
implemented activities and the continuous work on the value
chains of which the company is a part. A detailed review of Gabriel
A/S’s profile is available on the company’s website, where the
latest financial statements can also be found.

The main headlines in the CSR and environmental report for the
2012/13 financial year describe the company’s focus in the bigpicture perspective as well as the detailed perspective.
In the big-picture perspective, the companies ZenXit A/S, UAB
FurnMaster and Gabriel GmbH were established during the year.
At UAB FurnMaster a number of improvements were carried out
to the interior and exterior environments of the leased building.

CSR and environmental policies

Objective for quality, environment and CSR
Services provided by Gabriel must correspond accurately to customer needs and expectations. The company’s production
and ­distribution must proceed with due respect for the need to ensure a continuing reduction in resource consumption and
emissions which might have an impact on the environment. Gabriel’s position as a quality and environmentally conscious
company is evidenced by its certification under ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and the EMAS Eco-Management and Audit Scheme.

The objective is met via a set of policies. These policies apply
to all activities and they also influence how Gabriel works with
others in the value chain.

∙∙ Cleaner technology and environmental improvements are
regularly introduced into the supply chains with due respect
for the technical and financial consequences, and pollution
must be prevented.

CSR policy

∙∙ Gabriel conducts an open and close dialogue with the authorities on environmental requirements. The company has a duty to
respect relevant legislation and relevant statutory requirements
in the area of the environment as well as other provisions to
which the company has committed itself.

Gabriel endorses the principles in the UN Global Compact and
focuses on the following areas:
∙∙ Gabriel’s products and services are developed and manufactured
with consideration for the safety and health of users. Gabriel
strives in the production process to minimise environmental
impacts, and animal welfare is respected.
∙∙ A good working environment is ensured throughout the supply
chain, and country-specific laws and Gabriel’s own requirements
are complied with. These requirements comprise specific technical
specifications and matters specified in Gabriel’s Code of Conduct.
∙∙ Continuous skills and job development for all employees are
accorded a high priority.
∙∙ Gabriel wants to support students by providing internships,
and the company participates in research projects which benefit
both the students and the company.
∙∙ Gabriel communicates the company’s CSR activities openly
and supports the propagation of CSR as a managerial activity.

Environmental policy
The environmental management system covers all activities at
Gabriel and all products and services which the company supplies:
∙∙ The company’s general objectives are documented in a business plan prepared once a year for the period 1.10 to 30.9. The
business plan covers environmental goals which, together with
responsibility and competence, must be known by all employees.
∙∙ Energy has an important environmental impact, and energy
management is an integral part of Gabriel’s environmental management. Energy management covers supply systems with
significant energy consumption. Environmental goals and the
environmental action programme must include energy considerations and ensure ongoing improvements in energy consumption.

∙∙ Gabriel uses product labelling with the EU Ecolabel and the OekoTex health label. These schemes enjoy a high level of trust from
consumers, and awareness of the schemes is also increasing.
∙∙ Gabriel takes account of all phases of the products’ life cycle and
prioritises the environmental initiatives in those areas where
the influence and impact are highest.
∙∙ Gabriel will maintain the position as First Mover within the
industry, meaning that Gabriel assumes the lead in relation
to taking a position on and implementing new initiatives to
improve the environment.
∙∙ Gabriel prepares a report in connection with the presentation
of the annual financial statements. The report includes information on CSR and major environmental impacts and goals.
The report is available to the public and distributed to all the
company’s employees.
∙∙ Those of the company’s employees in contact with customers
must be in a position to provide correct information on Gabriel’s
environmental objective and policies. Guidance must be provided to customers and users on significant environmental aspects
of the use, recycling and disposal of the company’s products.
∙∙ The company’s suppliers must be selected in accordance with
their ability to fulfil environmental requirements and their willingness to enter into an open and close partnership to achieve
optimal solutions.
∙∙ Contractors working at Gabriel’s site in Aalborg must fulfil the
same environmental requirements applying to Gabriel.

FROM RAW MATERIAL TO FINISHED PRODUCT:
PROCESSES AND ACTIVITIES

Gabriel is a niche company which, in the entire value chain from
concept to furniture user, develops, manufactures and sells upholstery fabrics, components, upholstered surfaces and related
products and services. Gabriel is organised in a number of independent strategic business units (Masters) with their own
visions, targets, strategies and budgets.
The objective and policies set the framework for Gabriel’s CSR
work in the value chain, including how Gabriel works together
with selected partners. Gabriel has an influence on the entire
route from raw materials to the finished upholstered product,
and therefore has a shared responsibility in all stages both locally
and globally. The approach to the value chain always has CSR
and value-adding in mind.
There is focus on the complete life cycles of services to obtain the
largest possible environmental benefit of the efforts. This ensures
that a step in the life cycle is not optimised without noting how
it affects the environmental performance in the following steps.
It also ensures priority for the effort where the environmental
benefit will be greatest. The route from raw material to finished
product is illustrated in the model on the next page.
Significant environmental matters are determined on the basis
of systematic surveys, including measurements of input (raw
materials, water, chemicals and energy), measurements of
output (waste water, scrap and emissions), and setting up of
key figures. Gabriel also continuously monitors the analyses
and reports of institutes, authorities and others who are thoroughly familiar with environmental matters in order to identify
relevant concerns.
The surveys show that the following must be regarded as the
most important environmental matters in the products’ life cycle:
∙∙ Raw materials – New Zealand wool.
∙∙ Raw materials – polyester fibres.
∙∙ Raw materials – other products used in upholstery, e.g. foam,
metal and plastic.
∙∙ Energy consumption and waste water, especially in washing,
dyeing and finishing treatment.
∙∙ Consumption of chemicals.
∙∙ Consumption of energy.
∙∙ Scrap from production.
∙∙ Waste water.
∙∙ Transport of raw materials and finished goods.
∙∙ Disposal, including recycling of the products.
These matters relate primarily to suppliers and customers’ activities (indirect environmental impacts). Gabriel’s environmental
work is product-oriented, and to a high degree these matters are
worked with in cooperation with suppliers and customers. It is
therefore essential that Gabriel has a good relationship with the
suppliers to ensure communication of requirements and goals.

6

Gabriel has an influence on
the entire route from raw
materials­to the finished
upholstered ­product, and
therefore has a shared
responsibility in all ­stages
both locally and globally.

Environmental matters related directly to Gabriel’s activities
and properties:
∙∙ Consumption of energy and heating.
∙∙ Noise.
∙∙ Generation of waste.
∙∙ Transport for customer visits, supplier follow-up and other meetings.

High priority areas
Gabriel’s efforts are described under six main areas which form
the basis for implementing objectives and policies for CSR and
the environment. These six prioritised areas were chosen under
the following criteria:
∙∙ Matters prioritised by Gabriel’s CSR and environmental policies.
∙∙ Matters judged important by legislation.
∙∙ Matters judged important in product labelling, including C2C,
Oeko-Tex and the EU Ecolabel.
∙∙ Matters where Gabriel has an influence on effecting an improvement.
∙∙ The relative importance of environmental matters.

The six main areas
∙∙ Materials and resources
∙∙ Responsible production and management of suppliers.
∙∙ Environmental labelling and certifications.
∙∙ Development and innovation.
∙∙ The working environment.
∙∙ Gabriel Erhvervspark.
These areas are discussed in greater depth on the following pages, where an overview of positions, activities
performed, results and new goals is provided. This is
Gabriel’s environmental action programme, the details of
which show how the company intends to work on impacts
related to CSR and the environment in 2013/14.

fabric. Polyester can also be recycled in other products after
use. Gabriel works only with suppliers who can deliver high
quality polyester yarns which meet Gabriel’s environmental
requirements. Gabriel offers the product Comfort+, which consists of 37% recycled polyester. Work is ongoing to discover the
possibilities for increasing the proportion of fabrics based on
recycled material.

With the establishment of
UAB FurnMaster in the first
quarter of 2012/13, Gabriel
gained even greater influence
on the upholstery and sewing
work in relation to components
and finished pieces of furniture.

With the establishment of UAB FurnMaster in the first quarter
of 2012/13, Gabriel gained even greater influence on the upholstery and sewing work in relation to components and finished
pieces of furniture. The systems must be able to handle and
assess the environmental impacts of a range of new materials
such as foam and metal. Work is currently in progress on updating requirement specifications to include aspects concerning
the upholstery activities.

The largest resource in Gabriel’s products is pure new wool from
New Zealand. Gabriel has a long-term partnership with Wools
of New Zealand, which is a guarantee of high quality raw material and good conditions for the sheep. Wool possesses unique
dyeing properties, where the dye is absorbed into the fibre, and
the material absorbs light, meaning very attractive colours with
lots of depth and no reflections. Wool maintains its attractive
appearance in use, assuring the finished product a long service
life. Gabriel uses only high quality raw wool, thus avoiding many
chemical finishing treatments.
Polyester has come to comprise a significant part of Gabriel’s
product range in recent years. Polyester is the world’s most used
fibre, and it has properties which make it suitable for furniture

8

Chemicals are required in the dyeing and washing processes,
but Gabriel controls the choice and use of dyes and chemicals in
the suppliers’ production. The following are therefore not used:
∙∙ Chlorine compounds.
∙∙ Organic solvents.
∙∙ Dyes containing heavy metals.
∙∙ Dyes and pigments which can give off carcinogens.
∙∙ PVC.
∙∙ Bromine-containing flame retardants.
∙∙ Silver ions or other bactericidal treatments.
∙∙ Anti-moth impregnation (the substances in question are toxic).
∙∙ Other substances classified as carcinogenic or mutagenic.
This is managed to a high degree in Gabriel General Requirements,
which contain lists of phrases concerning undesired risks and
chemicals, and minimum requirements for fabric performance.
Work is also proceeding on how the resources can be recycled
in other products after use, with particular focus on retaining the
high value of the resources. After use, the components can be
handled as ordinary non-toxic waste or recycled in new products.

Materials and resources: Goals and results
Goals 2012/13

Enter into a binding agreement
with a recipient of polyester
waste, where the specific
quantities and use of the
waste product are agreed.
Establish a continuous partnership
on logistics to handle the waste
material.
Clarify whether own waste product
can be used as a resource for new
fabric products.
Establish the quality and
environmental requirements
for the material, including its
­purity, so that it can be used
as a resource for new yarn.

Launch at least one new product on
the basis of recycled polyester fibre.

Continue specifying ZenXit’s
­environmental and quality
­properties. Perform tests to
determine the quantities in
which recycled and new
materials can be mixed.

Results 2012/13

A binding agreement has not
yet been made with a recipient
of polyester waste for recycling
into new yarn.
During the year, Gabriel visited
a number of facilities which can
recycle polyester waste in various
ways. The visits revealed that there
are very few facilities which are
able to recycle the material into
new yarn of the desired quality.

Goals 2013/14

Carry out a development project
using recycled yarn as a component.
There is substantial focus on the
possibilities of establishing closedloop material cycles, nationally and
internationally, and Gabriel will
follow and be directly involved in
these projects.

The purity of the materials is
c­ ritical to high quality of the
­recycled product, and Gabriel
identified specific requirements.
Experience also shows that it
is ­essential to obtain a critical
­volume of material.

The product was not fully
­developed within the period
due to long delivery times and
the time spent on testing the
­product’s physical properties.

The goal is continuing in the next
period and is still to launch minimum one new product on the basis
of recycled polyester fibre.

UAB FurnMaster established ­
the use of water-based glue
and gluing systems were
installed for this purpose.

Establish FSC certification of wood
products at UAB FurnMaster.

The main focus in the period was
on development of the product’s
quality-related properties.

Gain CE-labelling of the product
to allow testing and launching in
special applications.

RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTION AND SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT

respect to business ethics and to help employees maintain ethical
behaviour. The Code of Conduct was developed on the basis of the
UN Global Compact and is in accordance with the recommendations of the industry organisation Dansk Mode & Textil.
Gabriel is a participant in Dansk Mode & Textil’s CSR committee
for promotion of CSR in the industry. More details are available
at www.dmogt.dk.

Gabriel has initiated a supplier
project which will ensure
a continued strong and
open partnership with
suppliers with the emphasis
on ongoing optimisation.

Daily following up on Gabriel’s partners in Europe is undertaken
by the team from Aalborg, while Gabriel Asia Pacific undertakes
equivalent daily following up on the partners in their region.
However, the development of systems and requirements as
well as approval of new suppliers takes place in close dialogue.
There is a close partnership with Gabriel’s partly owned dye works
UAB Scandye, including ongoing follow-up on environmental
projects and improvements. The environmental impacts from the
processes in the dye works comprise a significant proportion of
the environmental impacts attributable to the product during its
life. The overview of goals and results below shows parts of UAB
Scandye’s environmental results in the 2012/13 financial year.

Gabriel only collaborates with good partners in the supplier
chain who are capable of meeting the requirements applying
to products and services. Gabriel works actively to select and
improve the best possible partners.
Environmental assessment is a high-priority area in follow-ups at
suppliers, and Gabriel’s requirements include compliance by the
manufacturers with all local regulatory requirements. The suppliers are also assessed in relation to Gabriel’s own environmental
requirements, and together with the suppliers, action plans are
implemented to ensure that environmental impacts are regularly
reduced. The Oeko-Tex and EU Ecolabel schemes also place direct
requirements on the suppliers, and compliance is verified by a
third party. Partners are expected to comply with Gabriel’s Code
of Conduct, a set of rules which serve to provide guidance with

10

In future, Gabriel wants to increase the focus on the results obtained in the supply chain, and the reporting will thus include key
data concerning the most important suppliers’ activities rather
than specific data from UAB Scandye. In this context, Gabriel
has initiated a supplier project which will ensure a continued
strong and open partnership with suppliers with the emphasis
on ongoing optimisation.
UAB FurnMaster, which was established in 2012, is fully integrated in the quality management system for Gabriel A/S. Work
is in progress locally on documenting local quality and environmental management processes, and a number of improvements
to the physical conditions have been made.
Transport is a relevant factor as it connects production and customers. Gabriel’s work on optimisation of transport is continuing, so that most goods will be transported by ship or lorry. This
is also significant from a financial point of view.

Responsible production and supplier management: Goals and results
Goals 2013/14

Update ISO 9001 and ISO 14001
certification for Gabriel to include ­
a new upholstery supplier, and
structure certification around the
individual Master.

The project has been started up by
several Masters, the first of which is
about to be certified.

Minimum five Masters obtain an
­individual certification at the end
of the 2013/14 financial year.

Conduct courses for relevant departments in Gabriel, connecting CSR,
suppliers and the value chain.

The course programme was carried­out
in partnership with KPMG and Business
Development Centre Northern Denmark
in March-April and attended by DesignMaster, ­QEP-Master, LogisticsMaster,
­SampleMaster, MarketingMaster and
three external participants.

Conduct training in the individual
Masters concerning management
systems and processes as part of the
roll-out of the individual certification.

Examine how relevant KPIs and goals
for transport applying from next
year’s environmental accounts can
be set up.

KPIs have been set up for carriage
of goods from China to the European­
warehouse, where the choice of
­transport route is of significance
for the environment and prices. The
­proportion between sea and air transport indicates that 98.5% of the goods
­produced in China is carried by sea.

Continue to increase the proportion
of sea transport from China and, at
a minimum, maintain it at 98.5%.

This involves assessment by the
i­ndividual Master of its core processes and services, including how
quality and environmental conditions
­influence the Master’s services.

Extend reporting to include key data
concerning the most important
suppliers’ CSR results.
Establish a number of indicators to
be included in the reporting for the
next period.
Gain EMAS certification for the dye
works UAB Scandye.

The project has been initiated but is not
yet completed, so the goal continues.

Gain EMAS certification for the dye
works UAB Scandye.

Reduction in water consumption at
UAB Scandye to 135 l/kg fabric.

The water consumption was 143 l/kg
fabric, an increase of 2% relative ­
to last year.

UAB Scandye continues to set
­reduction targets to obtain ongoing
improvements, which will be included
in the future extended reporting of
key supplier data.

Reduction in electricity ­consumption
at UAB Scandye to 1.48 kWh/kg fabric.
At a minimum, retain gas
­consumption at UAB Scandye
at 1.08 m3/kg fabric.

The electricity consumption was
1.5 kWh/kg fabric, a decrease of
1% ­relative to last year.
The gas consumption was
1.02 m3/kg fabric, a decrease
of 6% relative to last year.

ENVIRONMENTAL LABELLING AND CERTIFICATIONS

Gabriel uses generally accepted and internationally recognised
product labels and certifications. On the product side, the EU
Ecolabel, Oeko-Tex, Cradle to Cradle and the Nordic Ecolabel, the
Swan, were selected as they are widely known and recognised.
Gabriel has frequently been at the forefront within the industry in
using new labels. In 2002, Gabriel was the first upholstery fabric
manufacturer in the world to use the EU Ecolabel on a large part
of the range, and in 2010, Gabriel was the first Danish company
to gain Cradle to Cradle product certification.
The product labelling helps to ensure that there is an objective
basis for proving that the communication about the products is
true. The labelling schemes mean that the product ranges are
subject to a number of different requirements and external tests
and approvals which are the customer’s guarantee of the products’ performance. This applies to both internationally recognised
product standards such as those concerning wearability and fireretardant qualities, and environmental matters.

Gabriel’s requirement is that an environmentally labelled product
must be able to comply with all the customer’s needs at the same
level as, or better than, a product without the label. All Gabriel
products comply with stringent requirements which reflect the
Oeko-Tex scheme or the EU Ecolabel. A certification under the
Cradle to Cradle scheme is also included in selected areas, and
this area is expected to be extended in the future.
Gabriel is certified under ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and EMAS. This
ensures systematic control of all parameters in product development and production, and ongoing performance improvements. A large quantity of environmental and quality data on
Gabriel’s products is available, and can thus offer specific details
if a customer wants a particular label on its product for a specific
market. Whether new product labels should be included in the
portfolio is regularly identified and prioritised as this can be a
route into new markets.

Environmental labelling and certifications: Goals and results
Goals 2012/13
All new products must carry either
the EU Ecolabel or Oeko-Tex.

Results 2012/13
Three new products gained certification under the EU Ecolabel.
Eight new products gained certification
under Oeko-Tex.
In addition, a large part of the existing
polyester and Trevira CS range obtained
certification under Oeko-Tex class III,
whereas it was previously class IV.

12

Goals 2013/14

­

All new products must carry either
the EU Ecolabel or Oeko-Tex.
Examine various labelling schemes
to establish whether they are relevant
to support sales on some of Gabriel’s
more recent markets.

Revise and update the product range
to meet new requirements under the
EU Ecolabel which are expected to
be adopted in March 2013.

The new criteria are expected to be
adopted in November 2013.

The deadline for revision and updating of the product range is 2015.

Together with key suppliers, Gabriel
acted as adviser to the EU Commission’s workgroup during revision of
the labelling scheme. The ­dialogue
focused on the requirements b­eing
commercially responsible and
­technologically possible so that the ­­
E­U Ecolabel can continue to be a widely used labelling scheme representing
the best products on the market.

Initiate any necessary changes to
­ abriel’s existing products after
G
adoption of the new criteria. In
­addition, update product requirements so that new products are
­developed with a view to the
updated requirements.

Extension of the C2C programme
to include at least one new
polyester product.

The project is at its concluding stages
before final launching and it is expected to be implemented within the next
few months.

Extension of the C2C programme
to include at least one new
polyester product.

DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION

Innovation and value-adding partnerships are the foundation
of Gabriel’s mission, and this is also reflected in the way the
company is working with environmental impacts. Gabriel wants
to be the primary customers’ preferred development partner so
that the customer sees it as natural to turn to Gabriel for advice
on new challenges. Gabriel is able to solve environmental tasks
throughout the product’s life cycle through close partnerships
with partners, and knowledge sharing in the supplier chain is
an important strength. Gabriel also wants to inspire customers
to take new pathways and apply a new focus in their work, to
discover new possibilities and thereby to offer customers new
solutions which can benefit their business. Gabriel’s policies
are determined on the basis that Gabriel wants to be a leader in
the area and wants the policies to go further than the limits required by law. This also protects Gabriel’s products against more
stringent requirements under the law because the company is
already at the forefront when new requirements are made mandatory for all.
There is a close working relationship between the Masters in
Gabriel on development of new products. Gabriel’s QEP-Master

(Quality, Environment and Production) is involved at an early stage
in the course of development, ensuring that requirements and
new possibilities are elucidated and integrated into the product
development processes. Higher priority is also being given to the
environmental work in the product development process with
substantial focus on inter alia Cradle to Cradle and recycling of
materials as important drivers of development.
On the networking side, Gabriel is continuing its good partnership with various knowledge partners, including Dansk Mode &
Textil, Network for Sustainable Business Development in Northern Denmark, Aalborg University, EPEA Hamburg and Cradle­
People as some of the more important partners. This also helps
to ensure that Gabriel is constantly challenged on its policies and
actions and is up-to-date with the latest knowledge.
In recent years, QEP-Master has also used its expertise with
respect to external partners who are not involved in Gabriel’s
traditional value chains. This helps to develop the work on quality
and the environment for these partners while also extending
QEP-Master’s area of business.

Development and innovation: Goals and results
Goals 2012/13

Results 2012/13
QEP-Master was chosen as adviser
in a process under the Network for
Sustainable Business Development in
Northern Denmark and will assist a
number of businesses with formulating plans for sustainable business
development. QEP-Master is part of
a consortium with Milestone Pro and
COWI on the task with QEP-Master as
the primary project manager.

Hold Cradle to Cradle training
­programme in cooperation with
EPEA, including participation of
external parties.

Knowledge and skills were accumulated in several Masters through
intensified internal cooperation
on Cradle to Cradle in the product
­development projects.

Prepare life cycle assessments
(LCAs) for two types of main
­products and communicate the
result to internal and external
stakeholders.

The LCA was carried out by a group
of students from the course Environmental Management and Sustainability Science from Aalborg University.
The analysis has not been published
yet. Data validation work is in progress
together with a major customer, and
the results are expected to be published during 2014.

Goals 2013/14

­

Extend customer portfolio for
­external consultancy.
Ensure consolidation of methods
and extend the description of services in the quality and environmental management system.

Continue the work on further developing the LCA models and results
with a view to publishing the key
conclusions, and incorporate them
in Gabriel’s environmental management system.

Gabriel must be able to attract and retain staff with the right
skills and knowledge required for the continued creation of innovation and growth as an international company. Gabriel gives
priority to everyone using, developing and sharing knowledge
and skills. All employees are familiarised with Gabriel’s vision,
strategy, targets and activity plans and are regularly updated on
their work situation as part of staff development dialogues and
staff meetings. This ensures that all employees work in accordance with clear goals and areas of responsibility, and that their
professional and personal development is stimulated.

Gabriel acts as a socially committed workplace, among other
ways by providing flex jobs, training places and trial jobs. Finally,
Gabriel wishes to support students by providing internships and
entering into training projects which can benefit both the students and the company.

WORKING ENVIRONMENT

The company is also active in health promotion, with focus on
healthy food in the canteen. Employees are offered free fruit,
there is an annual subsidy for sports activities, and participation is arranged in the annual DHL relay race in Aalborg. All
employees are also covered by health insurance.

Gabriel aims to be an attractive workplace for all employees
and also assumes a social responsibility in the local community.

­

Measure well-being and achieve a
result of 4.1 or better.

It has been decided to change the
form of the well-being measurement.
The result in 2012 was a high score of
4.1 out of 5, but there is a need to be
able to examine other, new parameters concerning, for example, culture
and innovation.

Carry out the measurement in its
r­ evised form and analyse the result.

Start recording sick days and
achieve a maximum of 3.5%.

Recording of sick days was initiated,
but the data are insufficient.

Launch a new time recording system
from 1 October which integrates
the recording in the company’s
work ­processes, thus improving the
­possibilities of analysing the data.
Achieve maximum sickness
absence of 3.5%.

Evaluate how an OHSAS 18001
certification can be obtained
in Aalborg.

It was judged that an OHSAS 18001
certification will be relevant for improving the possibility of imposing
demands in the value chain, and
other systems were identified which
can give a similar advantage.

Give the area higher priority and
i­mplement it as part of the roll-out
of Gabriel’s updated quality and
­environmental management system.
Increased focus on transport and
transport safety, since they represent
an important aspect of the global
working environment.

Gabriel erhvervsPark

Gabriel no longer needs special environmental permits to emit
waste water etc. because there is no longer any production in
Aalborg. The requirements regarding noise specified by the City
of Aalborg are complied with. The terms are given under Notes.
The emergency plan has just been updated, and Gabriel’s employees are trained in its use. A number of employees have also
taken courses in first aid and use of defibrillators. Other tenants
have been informed of the contents of the emergency plan and
encouraged to train their employees in its use.

Gabriel A/S’s head office is still situated at the location where it
all started in 1851. The old factory buildings have been converted
into bright offices with a sound and interesting working environment. The property now functions as Gabriel’s modern head
office and the workplace for a large number of companies renting
accommodation at Gabriel Erhvervspark. Gabriel is responsible
for operation of the building, including emergency plans.
The most important direct environmental impacts related to
­Gabriel’s activities arise in connection with the company’s activities at the address at the business park. These are energy,
heat and water consumption and generation of waste. An allocation scheme has been developed for environmental impacts
from the various tenants in Gabriel Erhvervspark: at the end of
the financial year, Gabriel’s share amounted to 54% of the total
property area. This statement details the business park’s total
consumption, as many of the facilities are shared. In consultation with the tenants, a system for measuring particularly heavy
impacts has been established, where the installations are structured such that consumption can be directly attributed to the
rooms used by the tenant.

Gabriel A/S’s head office is still
situated at the location where
it all started in 1851. The old
factory buildings have been
converted into bright offices
with a sound and interesting
working environment.

In the 2012/13 financial year, the reduction in heat consumption
from the previous financial year was maintained, and consumption is at the same level. Electricity consumption increased by 3%,
but a bigger increase was expected due to the establishment of
an air conditioning system in the old textile factory. The system
was not installed until the last quarters of the financial year and
did not cause any significant increase. As of 30 September 2013,
Gabriel Ejendomme A/S has rented out about 6,200 m2, corresponding to almost full occupation of the renovated building area.
Management regularly assesses how the property’s value and
income can be developed and optimised for the benefit of both
tenants and owners. These considerations include consumption
of electricity and heat.

NOTES: MEASURING METHODS AND BASIS OF CALCULATIONS

Accounting policies
This CSR and environmental report was prepared in compliance with the requirements of the EMAS regulation. Information in the report is based
on data from ongoing internal and external readings and reports under the environmental management system. The environmental report includes both absolute quantities and key figures.
Historical data
Pre-2009/10 data are not included because the earlier data include production. A picture comparable with the present impacts will thus not be
obtained if these data are included. Production was finally outsourced in May 2009 to UAB Scandye.
Key indicators
The reporting of key data follows EMAS-III recommendations to express the value A (the total annual input/impacts in the area in question), the
value B (the total annual output) and the value R (the ratio between A and B).
Energy
When converting m3 of district heating to kWh, a cooling of 35ºC is used. The calculation of emissions of CO2 for Aalborg uses the environment
declaration issued by Aalborg Fjernvarme in 2012. The district heating used is primarily waste heat from the production of electricity. The proportion of electricity from renewable sources is based on information in Energinet.dk’s 2012 General Declaration on Electricity. Emissions related to
the production of electricity are based on Energinet.dk’s Environment Declaration on Electricity for Green Accounts. Emissions of NOx and CH4
are not included as the quantities emitted are judged to be insignificant.
Waste water
Waste water emissions in Aalborg equal the purchased quantity of public potable water.
Waste
Waste recorded does not include construction and metallic waste from renovation of buildings and machinery.
Site use
Data for site use derive from the Ministry of Housing, Urban and Rural Affairs’ register. The undeveloped area consists of a park area bordering
the stream which was a premise for the chosen location in 1851.
Consumption of raw materials
The stated consumption of raw materials includes waste during production, which was approximately 5%. Commodities are also included.
Transport
The transport breakdown into sea and air for goods produced in China is calculated on the basis of invoices for carriage. The breakdown is calculated on the basis of the transports’ total weight in kg. Transport is computed by calendar year and does not follow the financial year. This
means that the figure computed for 2011/12 indicates data from 2012. The figure computed for 2012/13 is thus not the final result for the year,
and it could still change.
Product labelling
The proportion of labelled products is calculated by computing the total number of products in Gabriel’s standard range on 1.10.2013 relative to
the total number of products labelled with either the EU Ecolabel or Oeko-Tex.

The specified limit values for noise are based on the assumption that they will be observed within the following periods:
The limit values for the day period 07.00-18.00 (06.00-18.00 Monday-Friday) must be observed within the noisiest eight-hour period.
In the evening from 18.00-22.00, the limit values must be observed within the hour with the highest noise level.
For the night period 22.00-07.00 (22.00-06.00 Monday-Friday), the limit values must be observed within the noisiest half hour.
