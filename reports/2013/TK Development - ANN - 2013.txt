In addition to carrying on profitable business activities, TK Developmentintends to adhere to and expand the Group’s ethical,social and environmental responsibilities as a business corporation.TK Development fundamentally endorses the UN’s ten socialresponsibility principles, but has not acceded to the UN GlobalCompact. The Group only carries on activities in countries thathave already incorporated human rights, labour standards andanti-corruption principles into their national legislation.The Supervisory Board has not introduced any policies thatintegrate corporate social responsibility into the Company’sstrategy and activities.Reference is also made to www.tk-development.com/CSR_2012_13
