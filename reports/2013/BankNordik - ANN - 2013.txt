Recommendations

Corporate social responsibilityCorporate responsibility remains an important part ofBankNordik’s strategy. The Group considers responsiblecorporate governance a precondition for longtermvalue creation.The Group’s CSR initiatives are formalised in a CorporateSocial Responsibility policy. The managementbelieves that the Group’s CSR initiatives will yield thebest results if there is a natural connection betweensuch activities and the Group’s business strategy andcore competences. Therefore, the BankNordik Group’sCSR activities and initiatives are strategically rooted inthe Group’s vision, business strategy, core competenciesand business values.
