ALKâ€™s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

ALKâ€™s mission is to improve quality of life
by developing pharmaceuticals that treat
the actual cause of allergy instead of just
relieving symptoms. This is considered
a responsible way of managing allergic diseases from patient and society
perspectives â€“ not least because allergy
vaccination potentially prevents the
development of additional allergies and
asthma.
In ALKâ€™s products and product development, natureâ€™s own allergen compounds
are used as raw materials. Pollen from
grasses and trees, insect venoms, house
dust mites, etc. are cultivated, purified and further processed into active
ingredients for allergy vaccines. These
vaccines are then used by patients to
re-programme their immune system and
rebuild tolerance â€“ making it possible to
enjoy nature and withstand the natural
exposure to those same substances.
The amounts of biological and chemical materials used in the production of
allergy vaccines are very small, thus
affecting the environment at a very low
scale compared to most industries. The
gradual paradigm shift in physiciansâ€™
general treatment of allergy away from
short-range symptomatic treatment
towards using allergy vaccines to treat
the actual cause of allergy is, however,
creating sustained growth in the production of ALKâ€™s allergy vaccines.
As a growth company, ALK recognizes
the need to design and adapt corporate
processes with a view to reducing environmental impact, increasing employee
welfare and contributing positively to the
local and national communities.
Safety, Health, Environment (SHE)
SHE is well-integrated in the ALK organization as a whole and has been so for a
number of years. ALK has been environmentally certified (ISO 14001) and health

Denmark since November 2007.

The other production sites â€“ in Spain,
France, the USA and Canada â€“ comply with
these standards and are part of the close
collaboration to constantly improve Group
performance in the SHE field.
In Denmark, ALK received the Nordic Ergonomics Society (NES) corporate award
in 2009 for its â€˜extraordinary work to
improve the ergonomic working environmentâ€™.
Employee safety, health and welfare are
crucial parameters for a sound organization, and ALK is working systematically to
reduce work-related absence. ALKâ€™s occupational injury rate for 2009 for injuries
with more than one dayâ€™s absence from
work was 1.5 injuries per million working
hours, equivalent to three accidents with
absence from work in all of ALK. This
represents a significant reduction on the
previous years.

Moreover, a long-term SHE strategy
was defined, with the following areas of
global focus:

Energy consumption will be reduced
through a systematic implementation of
energy-saving projects at all production
sites over the next few years.

because of the relocation to a new plant
in Post Falls, Idaho, that is three times
the size of the old plant. To this should be
added the relocation to a new administration building in HÃ¸rsholm, Denmark, and extreme weather conditions

Overview of ALKâ€™s organizational development processes

ALK performs organizational reviews
every year to determine whether our
strategic goals are aligned with the resources available to the various depart-


RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The areas of special focus at ALK are professional and personal development and
cross-organizational collaboration. ALK
wishes to remain a workplace where employees see a focus on their development
and career and we want to strengthen
collaboration across departments and
national borders.

The results showed that ALK succeeds in
creating an attractive and challenging
workplace with room for employee performance and development, while also
achieving its business objectives.

Leadership A

The 2009 survey showed very good
results and progress in almost all areas
compared with the results from the previous survey. When comparing ALKâ€™s results with those of other companies in our
countries of operation, our performance
is generally above average. Ninety per
cent of all staff submitted their opinions
on ALK as a workplace in the employee
survey, conducted in the spring of 2009.

Employee development
ALK needs employees who desire and
are able to influence the company, who
thrive in changing conditions and a dynamic working environment. The employeesâ€™ general welfare and views on the
companyâ€™s performance are measured
every two years in a global employee
survey, which was last made in the spring
of 2009.

Organizational reviews are carried out every year. The leadership assessments, the overall employee
survey and the strategy process are conducted every two years.

ments of the company. Based on these
reviews, various initiatives such as supplementary training, talent development
and career planning are taken.
On the basis of an increased focus on
talent development, ALK developed a
â€˜High-Potential Programmeâ€™ in 2009
that is aimed at ensuring that we have
sufficient in-house talent to fill strategic
positions that provide optimal support to
our business and culture. Each year, we
identify a small group of employees with
the potential to fill these key strategic
positions.
Every two years, ALK performs a global
leadership assessment of all managers
followed by a verbal feedback procedure, and the outcome is a personal
development plan for each manager. On
the individual level, the purpose of the
leadership assessment is to help managers define their strengths and develop-

ment areas and lay the foundations of
individual development plans. For the
company as a whole, the leadership
assessment is used to direct overall leadership development initiatives according
to the results. In 2009, ALK completed a
global management training programme
which was conducted over a four-year
period and included all management levels. The programme comprised training
in Strategy Understanding and Execution, Change Management and Personal
Leadership.
In 2010, ALK will continue to focus on a
further strengthening of its performance
culture, with the objectives of:

through a development process based

Business ethics
ALKâ€™s Code of Conduct aims to support a
working environment where daily business is conducted with professionalism,
honesty and integrity, and in the best
interest of ALK and our stakeholders. In
our Code of Conduct, we adhere to the
UN Global Compact ten principles in the
areas of human and labour rights, environment and anti-corruption.
ALKâ€™s Code of Conduct was published in
the form of a folder and distributed to all
employees in connection with a general
presentation of these standards of business conduct. The Code was presented in
all parts of the organization, including all
production sites and subsidiaries; it now
forms part of the training and education
generally provided to employees.
ALKâ€™s Code of Conduct is available
at the corporate website:
