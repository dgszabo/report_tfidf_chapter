The qualifications of the Group’s employees are a crucial
competitive parameter. Therefore, the Group’s consistent and
transparent staff policy allows room for diversity and development. Moreover, the Group offers its staff a variety of employee benefits to promote their physical, psychological and
social well-being.
Environment
TK Development is involved in environmental issues mainly
when buying plots of land for the Group’s projects. If a plot
is contaminated, the Group will either remove the contaminated soil before starting construction or refrain from buying
the relevant plot. It is attempted to execute projects without
unnecessarily impacting the surrounding environment, including in connection with the choice of materials and the
actual construction process.
Local community sponsorships
TK Development sponsors and cooperates with local community members in aid of sports and cultural events.
