Statutory report on
corporate social responsibility
This statutory report on corporate social
responsibility (CSR) covers the reporting
period from January 1 – December 31,
2009 and forms part of the 2009 Annual
Report.
Schouw & Co. requires that all of the
Group’s companies comply with legislation and regulations applying in thecountries and local communities in whichthey operate. However, no policies havebeen adopted for voluntary incorporationof corporate social responsibility into thecompanies’ strategies and activities.Schouw & Co. generally respects theten principles on human rights, labourstandards, the environment and anticorruptionas expressed in the UN GlobalCompact.It is important to Schouw & Co. thatthe Group’s businesses endeavour tocomply with the principles of humanrights, labour standards, the environmentand anti-corruption and that theyseek assurance on reasonable standardswhen appointing business partners andsuppliers.The principles on the environmentmay require that a balance is stuck betweencost and effect, but generally theGroup is believed to maintain high standardswhen it comes to ensuring reasonableenvironmental issues and limiting environmentalrisks. In addition, the Groupaddresses environmental conditions froma business criteria aspect with due considerationfor the long-term perspectivesand the Group’s good reputation.Corporate social responsibility hasreceived a lot of attention from all sides,and as a result the Group expects todevelop and align its procedures for implementingand following-up on CSR overthe next couple of years.
