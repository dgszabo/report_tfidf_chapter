Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility

Corporate social responsibilitySydbank is a Danish enterprise operating as a responsibleplayer in society while respecting its business goals.Social responsibility incorporates being an active player in theactivities of associations and sports – locally and regionally.Numerous sponsorships are nurtured in Sydbank’s 17 Danishregions – with elite sports people and not least amateur sportsassociations on a much wider front. In addition Sydbank’sfund gives small and large donations for cultural and socialpurposes. Our local and regional commitment is the cornerstoneof our corporate mission and one of the reasons why weremain the business partner characterised by closeness andlocal knowledge – despite our nationwide presence.Also in relation to its employees the Bank takes its socialresponsibility seriously. Continuous initiatives within stress prevention,health promotion and senior policy schemes constitutesome of the reasons why Sydbank is regarded as a highlyattractive workplace. Also in terms of its environmental awareness,the Group has launched a range of initiatives in recentyears aimed at minimising the Bank’s energy consumption.The joint aim of the Bank’s CSR efforts is to emphasiseSydbank’s position as ethically sound – among employees, clientsand other stakeholders.
