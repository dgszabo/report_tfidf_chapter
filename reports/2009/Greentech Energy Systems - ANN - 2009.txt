Corporate social responsibility (CSR)


Corporate social responsibility (CSR)

The statutory report on corporate social responsibility forGreentech Energy Systems A/S is as follows.Greentech’s efforts to voluntarily implement corporatesocial responsibility as part of the Company’s strategyand activities have still not led to specific policies, andfor this reason no separate CSR report has been prepared.
However, during the last couple of years, Greentechhas dedicated in-house resources to CSR because theCompany wishes to develop its core business area in afinancially, environmentally and socially responsible mannerby complying with regulations in the countries andlocal communities in which Greentech operates and byimplementing voluntary CSR initiatives.Greentech operates in an international context with mostof its projects in Italy and Poland and a wide range of partieswith different interests. The Company’s wind turbineprojects are located in industrial areas and nature reservesand are monitored closely by local players focusing onenvironmental protection and the impact of the projectson the local environment. However, there are no specialenvironmental risks involved with Greentech’s activitiesas the output from our wind turbines does not emit anyhazardous particles or greenhouse gases. Furthermore, allprojects are subject to environmental permits, and at allproject stages Greentech is governed by comprehensiveenvironmental legislation and rules which, through surveysand analyses, serve to safeguard the surroundings of thewind farm, i.e. flora and fauna, local residents and thelandscape. In order to limit the environmental impact inthe areas in which the Company operates, Greentech alsoundertakes to replant trees and shrubs in correspondingareas if plantation needs to be removed for the Company’sconstruction activities. Given its presence in areas thatoften have a high rate of unemployment, Greentech alsocontributes to ensuring growth in the local communitythrough employment of local workers, contractors andsuppliers.

In its consideration relating to CSR initiatives, Greentech
has so far sought inspiration in the UN Global Compactinitiative for corporate social responsibility. In 2010Greentech will consider whether to join the initiative, andin that case the UN principles would come to providethe foundation for Greentech’s specific efforts to protecthuman rights, labour rights, the environment and anticorruption.The ongoing efforts to prepare policies will bebased on the Company’s business area, as this is the bestway for Greentech to contribute with relevant measures tothe benefit of the Company as well as its stakeholders.
