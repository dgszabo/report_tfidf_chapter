Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
As an international pharmaceutial
company, ALK has an important social
responsibility. ALK strives to live up to this
responsibility and be recognised by its
stakeholders as a reliable and responsible company characterised by professionalism, honesty and integrity.
ALK’s policy for social responsibility is
focused on the four areas below:

1. Prevention, diagnosis and
treatment of allergy
ALK is the world leader in allergy immunotherapy. ALK therefore has a particular
responsibility and is strongly committed
in its efforts to fight allergy. ALK makes
its knowledge and resources available to
promote the prevention, diagnosis and
treatment of allergy. ALK cooperates with
all relevant stakeholders to fight allergy,
including the public authorities and
private and public institutions, as well
as NGOs. A special focus area of ALK’s
social commitment is children suffering
from allergy, including their risk of developing asthma.
In 2012, ALK sponsored a project on
respiratory allergy undertaken by the European Federation of Allergy and Airways
Diseases Patients’ Associations (EFA).
EFA has published a ‘Call for Action’, encouraging European politicians and other
decision makers to ensure improvements
of prevention, diagnosis and treatment
of allergy.
Furthermore in 2012, ALK’s affiliates, in
cooperation with patient associations,
medical societies and authorities, have
undertaken activities to increase awareness of allergy and to make relevant
information available to patients and
their relatives.
The cooperation with EFA and the local
activities will also continue in 2013.

2. Production/environment
ALK works systematically to improve
working environment and environmental
conditions in every area of the company,
supported by the local SHE (Safety,
Health, Environment) organisations at all
production sites.

1

ALK has been environmentally certified
(ISO 14001) in Denmark since 2007,
while the other production sites in Spain,
France, the Netherlands, the USA and
Canada adhere to the SHE standards.
In 2009, the Management adopted
global long-term goals for the SHE-related activities focusing on the reduction
of energy consumption, including CO2
emissions. The objective is that absolute
energy consumption in 2014 will not have
increased compared to the consumption
in 20081 while CO2 emissions will have
decreased by at least 15%.
ALK has established a climate partnership
agreement with DONG Energy with the primary aim of reducing energy consumption
and thereafter reducing CO2 emissions. As
part of the agreement, ALK will on a continuous basis convert its energy consumption in Denmark to CO2 neutral energy.

3. Ethical conduct
In 2009, ALK established its ALK Code of
Conduct in order to support professionalism, honesty and integrity throughout the
company and in relation with customers, employees, shareholders, society,
suppliers and partners. All employees
are required to adhere to ALK’s Code of
Conduct, which will be updated in 2013.
In 2012, ALK has worked on establishing
a whistleblower scheme, ALK Alertline,
giving employees with knowledge of
potentially destructive or illegal acts
related to ALK’s activities the opportunity to report their observations. The
scheme minimises the risk of illegalities
and irregularities within the areas of
financial crime, environmental pollution or inappropriate conduct, as well as
other circumstances that may be to the
detriment of ALK.

In 2012, energy consumption was back
on level with consumption in 2008, after
adjustment for the establishment of new
production sites, closure of old production sites and acquisitions (cf. the Global
Greenhouse Gas Protocol). This is in line
with the objective for 2014.

Mid-2012, ALK received permission
from the Danish Data Protection Agency
to establish the scheme. ALK Alertline
is expected to be fully implemented in
2013, when all national approvals are
available.

Compared with 2008, CO2 emissions have
decreased by 13% as a consequence of
greater use of renewable energy sources.
Thus, ALK is close to reaching its objective for the reduction of CO2 emissions by
2014. In the coming years, a continued
decrease in CO2 emissions is expected
when the share of renewable energy in
Denmark will increase as a result of the
establishment of new wind turbines.

4. Employees

For the first time in years, ALK received
a complaint. A neighbour complained
about fan noise from the new administration building in Hørsholm. ALK’s
subsequent measurements showed that
the noise exceeded the permitted level.
At the end of 2012, part of the fan has
been replaced in order to bring the noise
below the permitted level.

ALK employs 1,855 employees, of whom
706 in Denmark. ALK wishes to continue
to be an attractive workplace that can
attract and retain the competent, wellfunctioning and committed employees
who are ALK’s most important resource.
ALK is therefore working systematically to
improve safety and the working environment, including the psychosocial working
environment, and to develop an organisation, culture and management that
encourage professional and personal
development.
Safety
ALK in Denmark has been health and
safety certified (OHSAS 18001) since
2007. In 2009, Management adopted

Consumption and emissions in 2008 will be adjusted in terms of establishment of new production sites, closure of old production sites, acquisitions,
etc., in line with guidelines prepared in accordance with the principles of the Global Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

global and long-term goals for the
improvement of safety and well-being at
work. The goal is to reduce the number
of absence days per employee due to
incidents at work on a continous basis.
In 2012, the number of absence days due
to work-related injuries fell to 0.045 days
per employee, which is a reduction by a
good 41% compared to the average for
the preceding three years.
Organisation, culture and
management
In 2012, ALK focused on strengthening
the company’s performance culture by
streamlining its performance evaluations
and by increasing the emphasis on development in performance dialogues over
the course of the year. In order to balance
tasks and enable employees to use their
resources in the most effective way,
special attention has been paid to the
‘dialogue of development’. All managers
have been trained locally in performance
evaluation as well as in the ‘dialogue of
development’.
In connection with the strategy process,
the explanation of ALK’s values has been
updated to better reflect the behaviour
expected at ALK. The values will now be
activated in connection with the preparation of the performance agreement for
2013. Both employees and managers will
be introduced to their roles in activating
ALK’s values.
As part of its optimisation of global HR
processes, ALK decided to revise and
integrate the employee survey and leadership assessment into one single survey
that will take place every two years, for
the first time in spring 2013.
In addition, on an annual basis, ALK
reviews the organisation in order to
determine whether its strategic goals are
aligned with the resources available to
the various departments.
Diversity
ALK sees diversity as one of the prerequisites for the company’s success, and this
naturally includes equal opportunities for
men and women to pursue a management career in ALK.
At present, two of the nine members of
the Board of Directors are women; there
are no women on the Board of Management, while there are five women among

the 27 functional managers, managers
of subsidiaries, etc. However, at the next
management levels, the share of women
is considerably higher – 35% among
mid-level managers and 49% among
first-line managers, including e.g. R&D
team leaders. Overall, women thus account for 43% of the managers employed
with ALK.

considered in connection with internal
and external executive recruitment, and
that women and men are part of ALK’s
talent pools for management positions.
Furthermore, ALK will use employee
surveys and leadership assessment to
systematically identify any barriers preventing equal opportunities for women
and men to pursue a career.

In 2013, ALK will continue its efforts and
commitment towards equal opportunities
for women and men at all management
levels. A central element of these efforts
will be to ensure that whenever possible
both male and female candidates are
