Thus the private equity funds’ policiesregarding responsible investment form an integrated partof the investment process.In cooperation with the management company, SPEASassesses (i) whether the private equity company hasadopted a code of practice or equivalent regarding responsibleinvestment, (ii) to which extent the private equitycompany considers other relevant ethical and environmentalissues prior to making an investment, (iii) howrelevant ethical and environmental issues are addressedby the portfolio companies during the holding period,and (iv) the ongoing reporting to the investors regardingstatus and development of same.SPEAS has only indirect influence on the individual privateequity funds’ choice of companies in which to invest,however, the Company’s basic premise is that companiescomply with laws and rules determined by national authoritieson the markets in which the company operatesas well as with internationally adopted norms concerninghuman rights and labour standards.If a private equity company has not adopted any recognisedcode of practice regarding responsible investmentor implemented a satisfactory policy in this regard, SPEASand the management company will enter into a dialoguewith the private equity company with a view to includingrelevant ethical and environmental issues in the investmentprocess.SPEAS typically receives declarations of intent from thefunds concerning the integration of principles regardingresponsible investment into their investment process andthe implementation of these in the portfolio companies.
