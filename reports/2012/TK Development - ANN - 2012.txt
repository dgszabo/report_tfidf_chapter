In addition to carrying on profitable business activities, TK
Development intends to adhere to and expand the Group’s
ethical, social and environmental responsibilities as a business corporation.
TK Development fundamentally endorses the UN’s ten social
responsibility principles, but has not acceded to the UN Global Compact. The Group only carries on activities in countries that have already incorporated human rights, labour
standards and anti-corruption principles into their national
legislation.
The Supervisory Board has not introduced any policies that
integrate corporate social responsibility into its strategy and
activities.
