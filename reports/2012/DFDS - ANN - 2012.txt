DFDS AND CORPORATE
RESPONSIBILITY (CR)
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY INSPIRES TO CREATE VALUE
FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND OUR COMPANY
CR WORK BEGINS TO TAKE SHAPE
The CR Committee had its first full year of operations in 2012.
The focus was mainly on the development and phasing in of
a model for managing CR work, including reconciling social
responsibility and value creation in the business.
We have decided to decentralise the CR work, as opposed to
setting up a Group function, to integrate it in the daily life of
the business areas.
Our corporate responsibility (CR) reporting is still a work
in progress. But already now we experience that reporting
requirements on measuring performance is inspiring development.
For example, in terms of damage prevention in freight, the CR
perspective has served as a catalyst for more regular measurement
and sharing of best practices across regions.
Increasingly, we also find that customers take DFDS’ CR efforts
into consideration in their decision-making processes. For example,
one company wanted to hear about it prior to booking a major
conference on one of our passenger ships.
Partly for this reason, we are in no doubt that integrating social
responsibility into our activities will ultimately make DFDS more
competitive.
Our reporting in 2012 does not include every item that could be
categorised under the umbrella of CR. However, in the areas that
DFDS considers the most important, e.g. emissions and health
and safety for passengers and staff, our reporting is well advanced.
However, we need to improve our ability to report on socially
beneficial activities that concern HR, our customers and suppliers.
One precondition for doing this is the introduction of better IT
systems for data acquisition.
Our most important goal for 2013 is to continue the integration
of CR work into the daily activities of the business areas. By
following this path, we believe the greatest benefits can be
achieved for all stakeholders.

DFDS ANNUAL REPORT 2012

Our approach to corporate
social responsibility
DFDS is responsible for a large number of employees and their working
conditions, and for health and safety at
work. We help keep Northern Europe’s
infrastructure and supply of goods running. We are responsible for passenger
safety, for customers’ freight and for the
environmentally sound operation of our
business. We are also responsible for
creating a return on investment in DFDS
– and much more.
This is reflected in a number of policies
and standards in areas related to social
responsibility. In several areas, specific
targets have been set for CR work – e.g.
reducing emissions – and customersatisfaction targets will be introduced
in 2013.
In addition to policies, DFDS has introduced an ethical code of conduct, which
acts as a supplement to the standards
of behaviour to which we aspire, as defined in The DFDS Way, see page 18-19.
Our CR strategy
The CR strategy aims to create and
protect value for stakeholders, thereby
underpinning DFDS’ position as a preferred supplier and employer.
Identifying stakeholders and understanding their needs and requirements
are important priorities in the strategy.
The stakeholders and their expectations
are listed on page 44-45. CR perspectives can be embedded in the organisation through internal initiatives and
action plans, but also through actively
involving stakeholders in relevant working processes.
The strategy also requires a significant
amount of communication with stakeholders and ongoing improvements to
our CR reporting.

CR REPORT

Managing the CR work
The CR strategy and its overall goals
and policies are set by the CR Committee, which refers to Executive Management. The committee is composed of
those responsible for CR work in the
different business areas and Group
functions. Niels Smedegaard, CEO, has
overall responsibility for the Committee.
The Committee meets at least once
every three months. The intention
is that external stakeholders will be
invited to participate in at least two
meetings per year. Twice a year, the
chair of the Committee will report to
Group Management, and annually to
the Management Board. An important
task for the Committee is to promote
the decentralisation of CR work to the
business areas and Group functions. One
Group Management meeting per year
will focus on CR work.

company should sign up to, for example,
the UN Global Compact, and whether
the report should be audited by external
parties. DFDS is still developing its
processes for collating and quantifying
CR data, and envisages that the extent
of reporting, including external auditing,
will increase over the next few years.
Working with stakeholders:
Value creation via CR requires the
involvement of stakeholders. Stakeholders are defined as any individual or
organisation that DFDS affects or that
affects DFDS. This includes stakeholders
without “voices”, e.g. the environment
and future generations.
Pages 43-44 list DFDS’ stakeholders,
processes for dialogue and collaboration, what is expected of us, and our
actions and plans.

The CR Committee is responsible for the
extent and development of DFDS’ CR
report, including assessing whether the

Significance of CR
At company seminars and by benchmarking with other companies, a
number of factors have been identified
that affect the welfare of employees,
customers and other stakeholders. Their
significance is calculated on the basis
of internal and external stakeholders’
perspectives and summarised in the
matrix above.
The hierarchy of significance is a
dynamic process based on knowledge
gathering and ongoing dialogue with
stakeholders.
Significant CR factors in DFDS
The top right-hand corner of the
table shows factors that are of great

importance to external and internal
stakeholders. For DFDS, these factors
are staff welfare, customer welfare,
greenhouse-gas emissions, fair employment terms and conditions and, fundamentally, compliance with regulations
and legislation.

CR REPORT

SAFETY AND SECURITY
THE SAFETY OF PEOPLE IS OF PARAMOUNT
IMPORTANCE TO DFDS

Corporate safety and security objectives
and requirements are determined by
national and international regulations.
Under the International Safety Management (ISM) code and the International
Ship and Port Facility Security Code
(ISPS), all maritime safety measures and
security factors must be reported for all
ships on an ongoing basis, and all ships
must report any incidents on board. This
can be anonymously under a ‘no blame’
policy according to Company Procedures
and international safety guidelines. In
our logistics business we are guided by
industrial and highways regulations as
standard.
The ISM code aims to ensure that all
relevant standards are respected, and
that safety contingency plans work. This
applies to safety equipment, safe ship
construction, management procedures,
training of the crew, drills, document
control, and formal safety monitoring,
structured management reviews and
auditing principles.
The ISM code also requires a designated
person ashore to ensure safe operations
and a link between the shore-based
management and the captain and crew

Operational Safety Performance is a
huge part of “THE DFDS WAY”, where the
implementation and roll out of global
systems supports the DFDS Operating
model in striving for continuous improvements and applying best standards across
flags. One of the core principles of managing vessels on different flags is to ensure
that the highest standards from one flag
is made applicable to the rest of the fleet
through our Safety Management System.

2010

Our approach
Part of DFDS’ customer service is to
ensure systematic implementation and
monitoring of safety standards. Safety
processes build on continuous improvement and sharing of best practices. In
our approach to managing health and
safety (H&S), employees, passengers,
freight customers and regulators are key
stakeholders.

DFDS’ Health, Safety and Environment
Policy, which is reviewed annually by
Management, strives to deliver improvement through active demonstration of
commitment and leadership at all levels
in the shipping and logistics businesses.
This means practicing what we preach,
where all managers behave in a way that
demonstrates safety and accountability.

mance monthly. Core to this process is to
review all safety and operational related
data collected from ships in readiness for
inspection by maritime authorities, and
is published to all vessels and key shore
based managers.

Our security management is governed by
the International Ship and Port Facility
Security (ISPS) Code, which helps protect
against terrorist attacks and other disruptions. Shipping and logistics are subject
to security inspections on a regular
basis. Audits are held in conjunction with
safety audits. The fleet regularly takes
part in exercises with different countries’
emergency services, in order to train staff,
exchange experiences and ensure the
ships are prepared for any eventuality.

We engage on safety and security with
relevant national and international
stakeholders, National Maritime and
Port Authorities, the Danish Shipowners’
Association, British Chamber of Shipping,
Nautical Institute, UK Passenger Shipping Association, International Chamber
of Shipping’s Passenger Ship Panel and
the Nordic Committee for Passenger Ship
Safety (“Nordkompass”). DFDS employees
sit on H&S meetings of Work Councils
and work with suppliers to identify safety
opportunities.

We monitor the vessel’s performance on
external surveys, accidents, incidents and
near-misses and review the outcomes
of regular audits on a monthly basis.
This approach involves clear targets for
shipping safety at business unit level.
Our Marine Standards experts, People
and Ships VPs and CEO meet to formally
review the vessels safety related perfor-

Training for situations requiring first aid
is also maintained. For example, each
year, hundreds of officers and all crew
are trained to various levels in paramedic
care and basic or advanced first aid. On
all passenger and cargo ships extensive
drills are conducted each week based
on around 15 different scenarios such
as marine evacuation.

Important events in 2012
All vessels are surveyed and certified
according to international, EU and national legislation, including internal audits
and inspections on safety and security
according to statutory instruments and
company procedures.
In 2012, the Lost Time Injury Frequency
(LTIF)1 was 3.3, up from 2.9 in 2011. Near
misses on average per vessel were recorded at 38.5, up from 31.7 in 2011. The
increase reflects a higher level of awareness on safety and the number of near
misses reported is expected to continue
to increase in coming years based on our
continuous focus to improve. There were
zero fatalities in 2012 in sea operations.
In August 2013 the ILO Maritime Labour
Convention will come into force, which is
applicable to all DFDS managed vessels.
This new set of rules apply minimum
standards on an international level in
terms of crew welfare, Food and Hygiene
Safety and safety related issues, which
will be governed, certified and audited at
the same level as the Safety Management
System.
In early 2012 LIVERPOOL SEAWAYS was
detained in Karlshamn, Sweden until
deficiencies were corrected, including
evacuation ladders that were too short.

DFDS’ Safety Management System
Safety management is operated by local management teams per individual
operating entity to maintain flexibility
and proportionality of response based on
risk. Thus, more safety controls are being
operated for higher risk activity (Terminals) than lower risk activity (Offices),
eg. formalised inspection regimes only
operated on higher risk sites.
The national and international safety
legislation applicable across the DFDS
Group has a common basis in EU Legislation allowing an internal safety management standard to be developed for
application within the DFDS Group ‘Dry’
activities based on a UK model of safety
management. The system is detailed in a
Safety Framework Document, a guidance
document providing a model for safety
management throughout ‘dry’ activity
(Port Terminals [Freight & Passenger
operations], Warehouses and Offices).
Internal auditing has been performed on
a risk-prioritised basis using the Safety
Framework Document to assess compliance; the audit programme will continue
in 2013, again, on a risk prioritised
basis.
Reporting
A network of 43 individual ‘data responders’ covering 59 operational sites has
been developed in 2012. This allows the
centralised collation of Group safety performance data on a monthly basis which
forms the basis of a monthly report made
available to management.

The following vessels recorded no lost
time accidents for 365 days or more by
the end of December 2012

Due to the wide variance across operational entities/sites, the reporting system
is both simple (so as to not over-burden
small, low-risk units) and yet sophisticated enough to allow the reporting of injury
accident detail allowing generation of
causal analysis. Causal analysis is used to
inform managers of trends for actioning
and to feed into managers’ ‘safety action
plans’ to ensure the proactive management of safety.
Manual handling and slip/trip have been
identified as major causes of injury accidents (both lost-time and minor) in 2012.
As both these causes are largely within
the control of the individual, the main
thrust of safety performance improvement in 2013 is to target the development of overall safety culture within
the workforce to grow the concept of
personal responsibility for safety; safety
culture development is complementary
to the overall culture of the DFDS Way
(continuous improvement with the organisation becoming a learning organisation).
Safety Performance
Overall, safety performance was satisfactory in 2012 with zero penalties, zero
fines etc imposed by regulators and with
72% of operational entities reporting ‘no
injuries’ at all.

Lost Time Injury Frequency is the frequency of lost work days per one million exposure hours. A lost work day is time lost from an injury which results in an individual being
unable to carry out any of their duties or to return to work on a scheduled work shift on the day following the injury.
Data exclude local operating subsidiaries AB DFDS SEAWAYS (Lithuania) and DFDS Logistics AS (Norway)

Thus, causal analysis has identified that
safety culture needs to be improved to
reduce the number of injury accidents, ie.
a general improvement of personal safety
attitudes and behaviours, rather than
improvement to the ‘hardware’ of existing
safety management systems/practices
being required. This will be addressed in
2013 by the provision of specialist safety
training.

The dominant causes of injury accidents
are slip/trip and manual handling; these
two causes combined account for 57%
of all injury accidents. Injuries caused by
both slip/trip and manual handling (and
handtools usage and tug driving) are
largely due to human factors (individual
mistakes and errors) by personnel who
have a large element of personal responsibility for safety.

Basic safety training is to be further
promulgated amongst the workforce in
2013 via modules delivered on-line using
an e-learning package which has already
been successfully piloted within several
locations in 2012. This methodology provides a very flexible, resource-effective
approach to safety training. This will
be supported by the provision of short,
in-house, training courses on a variety of
safety topics eg. risk assessment, event
investigation, to be made available as a
form of mentoring to personnel to assist
in developing skills in operating the
Group safety management system.
The Group safety manager attended an
18001 auditing course in January 2012
as research for the potential application
of this international standard within the

OUR APPROACH
Our human resource management is
based on The DFDS Way, which describes
the principles according to which the
company operates and the way employees are expected to act and conduct
themselves.
Our work with human resources (HR)
and social responsibility (CR) focuses
on employee health, safety, security,
training, career development, diversity
and working conditions.

HR POLICIES
DFDS has developed a range of joint policies in areas such as international management, employee assessment, training
and development, salaries and bonuses,
working time, employee satisfaction,
recruitment, work standards, ethics,
complaints and company cars.
Policies have also been drawn up regarding consumption of alcohol/drugs, employee development and officer replacement.
Joint policies are currently being drafted
on diversity and employee retention.
Many of these policies are clearly set out
in DFDS’ Code of Conduct, which provides
a framework for how DFDS employees
should act. This applies to working with
customers and suppliers as well as with
the outside world in general, on matters
such as, for example, the environment,
working conditions, health, safety and
financial transactions.
As a next step, a whistleblowing scheme
is envisaged that will allow anonymous

information about serious breaches of the
guidelines to be submitted.
Diversity
Diversity will play a crucial role in DFDS’
future growth. We believe that different
skills and ways of seeing the world and
meeting challenges strengthens our ability to fulfil our strategy and vision. DFDS’
workforce should be multicultural and
diverse in order to reflect the society in
which we live and work.
As diversity among employees and managers is important to us, we would like to
see more women in senior management
positions. This fits well with a Danish bill
requiring the 1,100 biggest companies
in the country, including DFDS, to set
targets for the number of women on their
boards. At present, women only account
for approximately 27% of the Supervisory
Board. Our ambition is to increase this to
at least 33% within the next four years
and at least 40% by 2020.
Based on company policy, DFDS has
drawn up an action plan containing
specific short- and long-term initiatives.
Each year, we will report on our goals
and progress in these areas.
New to DFDS
We have introduced a wide-ranging Group
Induction Policy to help new employees’
acclimatise to their workplace and to the
corporate culture and working environment. Under this policy, all managers will
be given guidelines to ensure that new
team members undergo a systematic
induction that is consistent with our core
values, The DFDS Way and our performance-driven culture.
Testing at DFDS
As part of DFDS’ recruitment process,
tests are used as a dialogue tool, but not
as a method of examining applicants.
Following the acquisition of Norfolkline,
the need arose to adapt these tests so
that they could be administered by a
single provider. During the summer of
2012, after assessing several providers,

we decided to use Thomas International for future testing. Certification and
implementation is taking place in the
period Q4 2012 to Q1 2013. Along with
the decision about the new testing tool,
a general group policy has been defined
that describes tests in DFDS and related
ethical principles.

HR ORGANISATION: PEOPLE & SHIPS
Responsibility for HR lies with People &
Ships. People & Ships is responsible for
personnel and human-resource development in both the Shipping and Logistics
divisions, as well as in the central functions, including Technical Organisation
and operating ships.
Employees at sea and on land are subject
to a number of collective-bargaining
agreements that vary according to seniority and rank/pay grade and under which
flag a ship is sailing.
HR and CR work is co-ordinated by DFDS’
Director of Environment & Sustainability,
who is chair of the CR Committee and
reports to the Executive Vice President
for People & Ships. This ensures highquality health and safety management
at sea and on land in accordance with
The DFDS Way.
Collaboration and local conditions
Three HR directors report to the Director
of People & Ships and work with local
managers to ensure understanding of and
respect for local conditions. This includes
working with the staff in health and
safety committees, works councils and
trade unions.
DFDS encourages open and trusting dialogue with unions and staff, who are also
encouraged to discuss any issues with the
relevant HR director.
In 2012, no fines, lawsuits or breaches
of rules were registered in the HR area.

DFDS AND DMMA INTRODUCE INNOVATIVE
AGREEMENT
In 2012, DFDS and the Danish Metalworkers’ Union
– Maritime Section (DMMA) drew up an innovative
agreement to set up a social fund. DMMA members
in service functions on a number of Danish passenger ships will be offered the option to reduce
their working hours, with compensation for loss of
wages (via disbursements from the fund), if due to
illness or for other reasons they can no longer cope
with a full-time job. This will allow them to retain
their social links to the workplace.
The fund was established with DKK 1m from the
Lauritzen Foundation along with additional support from DFDS’ Jubilee Foundation, and is funded
through payments by DMMA members and by
DFDS. These payments form part of the collective
agreement between DFDS and DMMA. A fund board,
comprising members from DFDS and DMMA, will
make decisions regarding payments. The chair of
the board, which will rotate between DFDS and
DMMA, is currently held by the Group manager for
People & Ships. DFDS would like to see similar
agreements in more areas.

PRIORITIES 2012
Improvements following the staff
survey
Our last employee survey was conducted
in 2011. The survey is conducted every
two years and involves all DFDS staff. The
study indicated a need for further action
in the area of personal and professional
development. As a result, a new training
programme, FOCUS, was introduced for
specialists and key employees. The two
programmes we ran in 2012 were highly
successful, and we plan to run three in
2013.
Training for customer project
A further need for training was identified in connection with the DFDS project
Customer Focus Initiative (see page 16
for an introduction to this project). HR
has therefore started to develop and
organise a training programme that will
encompass sales, customer service, skills
enhancement, etc.

Integration of CR into HR
In 2012, in order to focus more directly
on CR and the integration of DFDS’ HR
work, a working group was set up com-

CR REPORT

prising representatives from different
parts of the organisation. Within the CR
area People & Community, the main focus
is on inclusion, social impact and DFDS
as a workplace. The objectives include
defining KPIs for these areas.
Trainees
A new training programme, developed
along with the Danish Shipowners’
Association, led to the recruitment of
six international trainees in September
2012. They have commenced a two-year
period of rigorous training in our business
areas, combined with theoretical study at
college. A further six will be recruited in
2013 – this process has already begun.
Continuing education
In connection with the renewal of agreements in 2012, DFDS and the shipowners
reached agreement on a number of issues
with the Danish Metalworkers’ Union
– Maritime Section (DMMA). It is now
possible for seafaring employees who
are members of the union to take training
courses if they have no or few certified
qualifications.
The parties have discussed how this
should be financed and have agreed to
apply to various funds for support. In
addition, individual seafarers may enter
into a training agreement with DFDS,
which will then help fund their training
by paying a lower wages during the training period. Agreements with DMMA cover
most employees in catering and about
half of all other employees (deck/engine).
Apprenticeship scheme for ships
under the UK flag
Due to the demographic profile of our
maritime employees on vessels under
the UK flag, it is predicted that a large
proportion of our able-bodied sailors
will retire over the next 2–5 years. We
have therefore, in collaboration with the
Merchant Navy Training Board and the
British Chamber of Shipping, secured
funds for an apprenticeship scheme
for local youngsters in the Dover area.
We have begun collaborating with
local schools in order to attract suitable candidates. Apprenticeships are
combined with seasonal positions as
car-deck marshalls, which means that
candidates go to college for maritime
training during the off-season, and in the
high season, they return to the ships as
car-deck marshalls and gain practical
work experience at sea. The programme
was launched in November 2012. After
18/24 months, the first “local born and

bred” able-bodied seafarers will qualify
just in time to take over when the first
of the older generation retires.
Socially relevant support
Relationships with local communities are
mainly a local responsibility. DFDS disseminates information about local initiatives such as volunteering and fundraising projects initiated by employees. This
demonstrates DFDS’ values and inspires
others to take similar initiatives.

It is also complemented by initiatives
across the Group, including with the
support of the Lauritzen Foundation. One
example is DFDS’ ongoing collaboration
with the partially publicly funded company High Five (highfive.net), which finds
jobs for young people with criminal records. The aim is to give the participants
the opportunity to return to a normal life.
At present, five young people working for
DFDS were recruited in this way. In total,
approximately 30 youngsters have been
recruited to date, of whom 60% have
gone on to a permanent job.
Another example is the Christmas party
for homeless people, which is held in
December in Oslo and Copenhagen and
attracts approximately 200 attendees in
both cities. In Oslo, the event was held on
CROWN OF SCANDINAVIA, in co-operation
with Nettbus and the Salvation Army. In
Copenhagen, the Christmas party was held
on PEARL SEAWAYS, in collaboration with
the Mission for the Homeless. The crew
worked on a voluntary unpaid basis.
Behaviour – The DFDS Way
Throughout 2012, training sessions have
been organised and conducted under the
banner “Performance Management – The
DFDS Way”. This initiative is aimed at
managers and supervisors throughout the
whole of DFDS Seaways, including ships
from Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands,
Belgium, Germany and the UK, as well
as DFDS Logistics. The objective is to
provide managers with a set of tools
that will help them effectively measure
and manage performance and foster a
performance-driven culture.

Our approach
DFDS’ approach to the environment is
guided by company policy, as drawn up
by Executive Management and approved
by the Board of Directors.
The frameworks for the work and
reporting are laid down by the CR Committee, which is chaired by the Director
of Sustainability & Public Affairs. The dayto-day work is mainly done by Technical
Organisation and the Sustainability &
Public Affairs department, both of which
are a part of People & Ships.
As per The DFDS Way and its ambition of
continuous improvement and effective
sharing of best practices, local initiatives, departments and employees are the
main driving force behind work on the
environment.
The environment report deals with initiatives at sea and on land.
At sea
Reducing fuel consumption and CO2
emissions at sea consists of three main
priorities:
A: The interface between ship and shore
This includes schedules, arrival and
departure times, co-ordination between
ship and shore on arrival and departure,
load planning, loading, etc. The goal is to
make sure that the ship has the shortest
possible stay in port and maximum time

54

at sea. This allows us to cut the sailing
speed and fuel consumption.
B: Technical optimisation
Technical optimisation incorporates enavigation, including IT programmes that
plan optimal sailings based on detailed
information about ships and routes, along
with real-time information about currents,
water depth, wave direction and height,
wind, optimisation of the ship’s trim, etc.
It also includes the optimisation of engines, switching to more energy-efficient
propellers and rudders, cleaning of hulls
and reducing on-board energy consumption, which includes hundreds of initiatives
regarding pumps, heating, lighting, etc.
C: On-board behaviour
Via their behaviour, individual employees
and teams can make a significant impact
on energy consumption. A considerable
shift in attitudes has already been noted,
and each and every individual now aims
to help reduce energy consumption. To
support this, DFDS awards a quarterly
Bunker Prize to the ship that is best
at sharing experiences of the bunkeroptimisation initiatives implemented
on board. As all of the ships vote for
the winner, ideas are spread effectively,
everybody is kept up-to-date, and – as
per The DFDS Way – best practices in the
environmental field emerge.
Laws and regulations
The maritime environment is covered by
international and regional conventions
and laws, which are continuously adopted
and implemented. As far as DFDS is
concerned, the most important ones are
usually conventions and laws passed by
the UN’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) and by EU and national
governments.
Most of the rules that affect efforts to
reduce pollution from ships are part of
the MARPOL Convention.

DFDS ANNUAL REPORT 2012

The MARPOL Convention regulates the
use of hazardous substances, the processing and discharge into the marine environment of potentially environmentally
harmful substances (e.g. sewage, oily
water and ballast water) and emissions
into the atmosphere of potentially environmentally harmful substances such as
CO2, NOx and sulphur from ships’ engines.
The AFS Convention governs the use of
antifouling paints on ships. The routines and processes that ensure compliance with these rules are described and
documented in the company’s safetymanagement system, International Safety
Management (ISM), which is maintained
and updated by the Marine Standards
department. A complete, updated version
is available on all ships.
DFDS and each of its ships are regularly
audited, both internally and by external authorities. This ensures that the
regulatory framework and the necessary
routines are known and respected.
On land
On land, standard EU and national laws
govern our work.
Environmental work on land is initiated
by Health, Safety & the Environment, a
sub-section of the Sustainability & Public
Affairs Department in the People & Ships
Division. Local management also initiates
activities.
For example, activities on land must comply with legislation relating to climate
change, e.g. Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) in the UK – a government
scheme designed to promote efficiency
amongst medium and large energy
consumers.
In ports and terminals, every effort is
made to improve energy efficiency in
buildings, plant and equipment.

CR REPORT

As part of our customer service, DFDS’
logistics units in Belfast, Bruges, Ghent,
Gothenburg and Helsingborg are ISO
14001 EMS-certified.
Environmental risks
The main commercial risk factors are
changes in environmental regulations
and increases in energy prices. The environmental policy contains guidelines
for the analysis of costs associated with
new regulations and their implementation, as well as the potential costs of
solutions.
Legislation on sulphur content
in bunkers
A particular risk is the introduction in
2015 of IMO rules about not using fuel
with more than 0.1% sulphur content
in a special control area comprising the
Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English
Channel. This entails a risk that inflated
prices for low-sulphur oil and generally
higher costs for shipping could, in some
transport corridors, lead to a greater
proportion of freight customers opting
for land-based transport solutions, which
would have unintended environmental
effects on land.
DFDS has adopted an innovative course
to meet this challenge, and is studying
solutions using new technology. In 2008,
the company initiated collaboration with
Alfa Laval and MAN Diesel to test new
scrubber technology on the freight vessel
FICARIA SEAWAYS, making it a pioneer in
the use of sulphur scrubbers on a ship’s
main engine. The scrubber removes
sulphur dioxide and particles from the
exhaust fumes. Lloyds has been involved

in the testing and auditing of the results
for the device. As well as the technical
development of the marine scrubber
system, DFDS has also been involved in
developing the regulatory framework that
underpins their use.
However, despite the positive results
on FICARIA SEAWAYS, a range of factors
place limits on the use of scrubbers,
including their size and weight, installation complexity and the stability and
age of the vessel. Dialogue with the EU
on funding for this kind of environmental
investment will therefore continue.
Alternative fuels are also being considered. Liquefied natural gas (LNG)
may be suitable in some new ships, but
the supply chain, price and practical
implementation require further study
and development. Although the shipping
industry is prepared to invest, we (and
our competitors) fear that switching to
alternative solutions will not be feasible
for ships within the deadline stipulated
by the EU Directive.
Cleansing ballast water
Similarly, new regulations for cleansing
ballast water, which are designed to
counteract the spread of invasive species,
will also present a major challenge for
shipping companies, as they will need to
invest in on-board waste-water treatment
plants, grater tank capacity, etc.
Design index for ships (EEDI)
Under the auspices of the IMO and the EU,
an Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI)
has been adopted, which states that
efficiency must be incorporated into ship
design in order to reduce CO2 emissions.

FLEET FUEL CONSUMPTION 2007-2012
(FUEL CONSUMPTION, G/GT/NM)

An EEDI has not yet been adopted for ro-ro
and ro-pax ships, as a calculation method
that will be accurate and useful for these
types of vessel has not yet been identified.
DFDS is involved in the dialogue and work
to find a fair and workable calculation that
takes into account the special conditions
that apply to these ships.

PROGRESS IN 2012
CO2 intensity
Fuel consumption (bunker oil) is the main
source of CO2 emissions from ships. Total
consumption varies over time as the fleet
changes. In order to trace trends on a transparent and objective basis, consumption is
measured in grammes per gross ton (GT)
per nautical mile (g/GT/nm).
The target of reducing CO2 emissions
by 10% was achieved in 2012.
However, the fleet has undergone
substantial changes in this period and
bunker consumption has been systematically quantified and monitored. With the
acquisition of Norfolkline, DFDS acquired
a significant business area in the English
Channel, which altered the ratio of ro-ro
to ro-pax ships. Ro-pax ships, especially
those on short routes in the English
Channel, are more fuel-intensive, which
affects the level of savings on energy
consumption. It is also significant that, in
the first five years, DFDS has reaped the
benefits of a number of readily accessible
opportunities to achieve savings.
In spite of all this, we have now set
ourselves the target of reducing fuel
consumption per nautical mile per GT by
an additional 5% by 2017.
In 2012, the average consumption (in g/
GT/Nm) for the whole fleet was 1.9%
lower than in 2011.

7.0

As shown in the figure, the changed profile of the fleet following the acquisition
of Norfolkline has had an impact on the
overall trend for fuel consumption. However, for all types of ships, the trend is for a
steady reduction in consumption.

As seen in the tables on p 56, the target

and 2012 has been reached (11.18%) if
Norfolkline ships are excluded. If they are
included, the reduction in the period was
9.5%. If neither the former Norfolkline
ships nor the other vessels deployed on
the English Channel in 2012 are included,
the reduction was 18.4%.

SAVE ENERGY WITH LED BULBS
An example of the many small initiatives taken
on board DFDS ships is the three Dover–Dunkirk
ships on which the lighting really lives up to the
company’s goal of cutting energy consumption and
CO2 emissions. Over the past year, almost 90% of
the bulbs in the passenger areas have been replaced
with LED bulbs. A total of 2,346 bulbs have been
changed, resulting in a saving of 94,376 watts per
hour for all three ships. The big 800- and 400-watt
floodlight bulbs on deck have been replaced with
86- or 56-watt LED bulbs, resulting in a saving of
more than 29,754 watts per hour.

Improvements in logistics activities
On land, port terminals and distribution hubs are becoming more energy
efficient, e.g. through the establishment
of an Energy-management Team (EMT).
In Larkhall and Belfast, for example, new,
more efficient cooling technology is
expected to generate annual electricity
savings of 30%. Increasingly environmentally efficient trailers and refrigerated vehicles are being used, including
in collaboration with customers, e.g. the
supermarket chain ASDA in Great Britain,
which uses double-decker trailers to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions per
transported pallet. DFDS is also taking
part in a public trial in Great Britain and
Northern Ireland to test special long trailers that will reduce energy consumption
per transported unit.
Work is ongoing with suppliers on the
use of more fuel-efficient trucks, and we
are continuously investing in upgrading
the truck fleet to more energy-efficient
and environmentally friendly EURO 5
trucks. In 2012, the proportion of EURO
5 trucks in DFDS’ 150-vehicle fleet
reached 50%. In Peterborough, the whole
fleet has now been replaced with EURO
5 trucks.
Throughout the year, a number of local
initiatives were implemented to reduce
the number of kilometres driven without
a load, which also helps to reduce energy
consumption. The main focus was on
planning and the use of IT tools. Gathering trailers and containers into larger
pools is a particularly good way to plan
this work more efficiently.
Environmental collaborations
and partnerships
Considerable environmental benefits can
be achieved by devising joint solutions in
collaboration with suppliers, customers,
authorities and other partners.

Ship Energy Efficiency Management
Plan (SEEMP)
On 1 January, a new rule came into
force. All ships over 400 GT must have
a Ship Energy Efficiency Management
Plan (SEEMP). This is an IMO initiative
aimed at improving the energy efficiency
of ships. DFDS was well prepared to
implement the plan, since we had already
made a well-documented and structured
effort to plan and implement energy-efficiency initiatives, including quantification
and follow-up. SEEMP can be integrated
directly into the DFDS maintenance system Sertica, which staff on the ships are
trained to use.

DFDS ANNUAL REPORT 2012

In 2012, in addition to the extensive cooperation with Alfa Laval, MAN and the
Danish environmental authorities on the
development of a sulphur scrubber (discussed above), DFDS worked with several
other partners on a range of environmental initiatives. Projects included:
High-efficiency water-cleansing system
DFDS has installed and tested a new
system for cleaning oily bilge water on
PEARL SEAWAYS. It is more efficient and
reliable, faster and cheaper to operate
than existing ones, and is also certified as
per IMO regulations. The cleansing effect
far exceeds the requirements for bilge

CR REPORT

water, which are currently max. 15 parts
per million (ppm) oil residue. The new
system produces bilge water with less
than 5 ppm.
Catalytic reactor on PETUNIA SEAWAYS
The manufacturer and supplier MAN has
developed a new catalytic reactor that
effectively purges ships’ smoke of NOx.
A pilot model was built into the engine
room and chimney system of PETUNIA
SEAWAYS in 2012. It is now being
tested in regular daily operations in
the North Sea.
Shore power
In accordance with the rules and as part
of the campaign air emissions in ports,
DFDS has been using fuel oil with a sulphur content of less than 0.1% while in
port since 2010. Locally, this has resulted
in a 90% reduction of sulphur in air
pollution. In some ports, nitrogen oxides
(NOx) are also removed using catalysts.
With the help of local measures, DFDS
is also continuously striving to reduce
noise from ships’ generators, ventilation
systems and port operations.
Another effective tool for improving
the environment in port areas is the
establishment of shore-based electricity
supplies, which enable ships to be powered from the grid while in port. DFDS has
entered into collaboration with the Port
of Ghent, Volvo Group and the EU (which
will support the project with EUR 1m)
on shore power in the ports of Ghent, Immingham and Gothenburg, as well as on
the six ships calling at these ports. DFDS’
investment in the project is approximately DKK 50m. The plants are expected
to be ready to conduct shore-power tests
by 2014. These particular ports and ships
were chosen because they have the best
conditions for setting up shore power, i.e.
in terms of the ships’ length of stay in
port, the fact that the ships are expected
to be deployed on these routes on a
long-term basis, and the nature of ports
and ships.
Dialogue with neighbours
In our port terminals, for example in Rotterdam, as well as on the ships, e.g. between Oslo and Copenhagen, DFDS enjoys
and wishes to continue a positive dialogue with our neighbours regarding the
inconvenience that shipping can cause,
what we can do to reduce it and how
best to create understanding between the
parties through meetings, neighbourhood
visits and other initiatives.

NEW SAILING TIMES SAVE FUEL
On 2 April 2012, departure times for the two passenger
ships on the Copenhagen–Oslo route were modified to
reduce oil consumption. The ships embark 15 minutes
earlier and arrive 15 minutes later, so spend an extra
half hour at sea every day. This cuts oil consumption
by more than two tons per ship per day, which
corresponds to a reduction in CO2 emissions of over
6.4 tons per ship per day.

Waste processing and recycling of ships
Waste is produced by most activities on
board ships and in logistics centres. Oil,
chemicals and water used for cleaning
purposes must be processed in accordance with environmental legislation
(see the section on cleaning bilge water,
above).
On the passenger ships on the Copenhagen-Oslo route, DFDS, in co-operation
with an external company and in accordance with the rules in force in the
two countries where the ships dock, has
developed a particularly efficient and
environmentally friendly overall plan
for the processing and disposal of waste
from the ships’ operations, including the
kitchens, passenger departments, etc.
Ships are scrapped in accordance with the
IMO’s proposal to the Hong Kong Convention of 2009. In future, this will be done in
accordance with the rules currently being
discussed by the EU, which are expected
to be adopted soon. DFDS did not scrap
any vessels in 2012.

CR CUSTOMERS
OUR GOAL IS TO BE OUR CUSTOMER’S
PREFERRED SUPPLIER
Our approach
DFDS’ approach to all customers is based
on the five elements of our guiding star to
customer service. We regard these as the
key building blocks to customer service
excellence, be that in a restaurant on
one of our ships or as a freight customer
requiring products delivered on time and
in good condition.
We recognise that customers increasingly
seek to understand companies’ corporate
responsibility (CR) policies and practices
and aim to communicate these clearly
in this report. Of particular relevance for
DFDS’ customers are safety, security, and
the impact of transport services on the
environment. Reporting on these areas
of CR is available elsewhere in this report.
Our freight customers (B2B)
DFDS Seaways’ route network comprises
30 routes with freight services offered on
all routes. The main activity is shipping
of unaccompanied and accompanied
trailers for our largest customer segment,
forwarding companies and hauliers. For
manufacturing companies, heavy goods
such as automobiles, steel, paper and forest products, and chemicals are transported. The network also carries containers
and project cargo for the offshore and
renewable energy industries.
Freight customers thus range from drivers
accompanying their vehicles, to haulage
and forwarding companies and large
industrial production companies. For the
latter customers, DFDS’ services are an
integrated part of the company’s supply
chain based on multi-year contracts,
which often involve considerable investments in cargo carrying equipment and
IT-systems. In some cases, deployment of
larger ships to accommodate volumes, or
ships with hanging decks for automotive
logistics, are necessary.
DFDS Logistics provides door-to-door
transport services for customers with full
and part loads, both ambient and temperature controlled. Rail and warehousing
services are also provided for customers.
More complex logistics services that

58

are an integrated part of the customer’s
supply chain are also provided, mostly
for retailers and producers of temperature
controlled goods.
All in all, DFDS provided transport and
logistics services to thousands of customers in 2012. On the freight routes a
total of 25 million lanemetres of freight
were transported. The door-to-door and
logistics services transported 330,000
freight units.
We continue to demonstrate commitment
to our customers through ongoing investments in ships, port terminals, cargo
carrying equipment, warehouses, IT
systems and training.
Improving our customers results
We recognise that one of our responsibilities is to help our customers become
more competitive through delivering
efficient services. This requires continuous
improvement in all parts of our operations,
supported by a structure that nurtures innovation and spreads best practice.
DFDS’ Fleet, Terminal, Rail, Haulage and
Equipment competence centers contribute to growing efficiency and cutting
costs. This work is supported by our
Industry and Key Account Manager Teams
that in collaboration with the local offices
drive improvements to customer services,
sales excellence and product offerings.
Actions in 2012
Cargo care & claims handling: When
customers place their cargo in our care
they rightly expect that we will treat
it with care, from point of collection
through to final delivery. We work intensively with damage prevention based on
performance measurement, operational
reviews, sharing of best practice, training
and awareness. This is done in close
cooperation between our Operational
Competence Centers, ie. the Terminal
Competence Center, local offices and the
Claims Management team. Statistics and
learnings are exchanged to drive through
efficiencies and minimise damage to our
customer’s cargo.

DFDS ANNUAL REPORT 2012

We share the results of this work with our
customers as it often can provide customers with opportunities to improve own
operations and the type of equipment
they use.
However, due to the significant volumes
involved damages do occur. When they
do we aim to handle the claims process
in a fair, fast and effective manner, which
ensures all claims are settled quickly and
correctly.
We adhere strictly to our Terms & Conditions, which are build on international
conventions such as Hague Visby and
CRM, and always refer to them as part
of our quotation process in a clear and
conscise manner, giving customers the
opportunity to understand them fully
before placing orders.
Online freight bookings (InfoBridge): To
further simplify the booking process and
information exchange, the online booking
system (InfoBridge) was upgraded with
new, customer friendly features, including
a new screen lay-out making InfoBridge
quicker and easier to use for customers.
The system will be further upgraded during 2013 with the aim of becomingindustry leader in terms of e-Business.
Enhanced terminal operations: To
improve reliability and reduce our
carbon footprint we continuously seek
to increase the turn-around times of our
vessels in a safe manner. The net effect
has been a reduction in fuel consumption
and an improved service to customers.
POD service: As an ongoing part of efforts
to improve services and competitiveness,
DFDS Logistics will introduce a mobile
phone based POD service during 2013.
Equipment innovation: In order to lower
DFDS’ environmental impact, the fleet of
Supercube trailers, capable of carrying up
to 52 pallets, has been increased. Working closely with major retailers, this project has helped to reduce truck numbers
and provide a significant reduction in CO2
per pallet moved.

FAST COMMUNICATION
WHEN IT MATTERS

DFDS also participates in trials conducted by the Department of Transport
to operate longer semi trailers in the UK.
The Department for Transport started
the trials of 1,800 longer semi-trailers
in January 2012. The trial involves
semi-trailers of 14.6m in length (1 metre
longer than the current maximum),
and semi-trailers of 15.65m in length
(2.05 metres longer). This brings the
total maximum length of the articulated
vehicle to 17.5 metres for the first trial
category and 18.55 metres for the second. The trial provides the opportunity
to establish the environmental and
safety impacts of each length.

Our passengers (B2C)
In DFDS’ route network, passenger
travel services are offered on 13 routes.
A total of 5m passengers travelled on
these routes in 2012. The short crossings between France and the UK in the
English Channel recorded the highest
passenger volume with 3.3m passengers.
Like the English Channel, DFDS’ passenger
routes in the Baltic Sea mainly serve the
demand for transportation among its passengers and attracted 201k passengers
in 2012. Furthermore, 1.4m people sailed
on the three overnight cruise-ferry routes
that connect the Netherlands, the UK,
Denmark and Norway.

It is a key goal for DFDS to offer an experience to its customers across Europe that
is in line with or exceeds their expectations. In order to live up to that goal,
a safe journey for all passengers is of
utmost importance. Safety on board the
ships has highest priority and you find

more information on regulations and
initiatives in the ‘Safety and Security’
section of this CR report, see pp 47-50.
In addition to taking responsibility for
all passengers’ safety, understanding
customer needs is the cornerstone of
DFDS’s approach to satisfy customer
expectations.
To accommodate and foster a customer
centric approach within the company’s
organizational structures, a special Passenger Competence Center (PCC) was
created. Its purpose is to increase consistency of passenger operations and to show
‘one face to the customer’. Goals and
tasks of the PCC include a unified level of
customer service, alignment of all activities and services with DFDS standards,
conformity in marketing communication
and an overall travel experience that
meets high standards on all DFDS routes.
Customer surveys and customer
service projects
In DFDS, we have over the years developed a strong sense for our customer’s
expectations through ongoing and comprehensive Customer Satisfaction Surveys (CSS). The surveys enable a deeper
understanding of customer demands and
a transformation of those findings into
day-to-day operations and services on
board. The CSS provides the customers
with the possibility to give individual
feedback to DFDS and thereby contribute
to the continuous process of adapting
the on board experience to passengers’
expectations.
To support our capability for continuous
improvement two important initiatives
were created and promoted in 2012.
The Customer Focus Initiative (CFI)
cuts across the Group and will be a key
initiative for DFDS in 2013. The project
incorporates further research on customer values that is central to retain and
improve today’s high level of satisfaction. The diverse set of CFI work streams
includes many facilities and service areas
on board like restaurants, recreational facilities as well as entertainment on board.
See also p 16 for an introduction to CFI.
Secondly, the Compax initiative focuses
on DFDS’ passenger operations in the Baltic Sea. By identifying improvement potential for passenger service throughout
the whole voyage, from ticket purchase to
disembarking the ship, the project team
aims at raising customer satisfaction for
the Baltic routes.

Data protection
For the described continuous and project
based improvements, DFDS addresses
customer specific needs through analysis
of customer information. Within the scope
of any such evaluation, DFDS consistently
respects data privacy and complies with
the European Data Protection Directive
(95/46/EC) as well as with the national
data protection acts in the countries we
operate in. In consequence, marketing
communication is only sent to individuals
who have explicitly agreed to this. DFDS
further follows the process of enacting
the proposed “European General Data
Protection Regulation” to ensure compliance with new regulation.
Passenger rights
DFDS follows the European Maritime Passenger Rights Regulation (1177/2010)
that entered into force in December
2012. In accordance with the regulation,
DFDS ensures that assistance is offered
to disabled passengers and those with
reduced mobility. From the booking, to
port facilities and the voyage on board
the DFDS vessel, passengers with special
needs are supported and appropriately
informed. Further topics of the Regulation
that DFDS covers include transparency
in pricing across countries and the entitlement of passengers to certain rights in
the event of delay or cancellation.
Communications with passengers
DFDS puts high emphasis on informing
all passengers about the various important matters of their journey. A lot of this
communication takes place directly at the
check-in and on board the ships. However,
a significant and increasing proportion
of information is given through different channels, including the internet.
Developments range from service calls
prior to departure to increased social
media presence that help to fulfill DFDS’
responsibility of informing passengers on
all matters of importance. The approach
to social media is decentralized and country specific, supported by an overarching
DFDS social media guideline that ensures
consistency across markets.
Acknowledgements
The DFDS approach towards meeting
customer expectations has been acknowledged by several awards throughout the
year 2012. Especially the recognition
for sophisticated customer service mirrors the effort towards meeting or even
exceeding customer expectations.

Supplier Code of Conduct
Responsible Procurement
Responsible procurement is part of
DFDS’ CR strategy with bearing on brand,
reputation, relationships and customer
orders. Group Procurement work closely
with suppliers on a day-to-day basis and
suppliers’ feedback and innovations are
valued by DFDS.
To do business with DFDS a supplier
must conform to the DFDS Supplier Code
of Conduct and thereby comply with all
applicable international conventions and
national legislation in the country where
the work or service is being performed,
and specifically the supplier must respect
the following:

in the country where the product is
manufactured or the service performed.
At the request of DFDS, the supplier must
actively participate in DFDS’ follow-up on
compliance with DFDS’ Supplier Code of
Conduct through dialogue, questionnaires,
systematic reporting, visit to the supplier’s address(es) or by other means of
verification or control which DFDS might
wish to use.

Our approach
DFDS’ Group Procurement covers some
1.000+ suppliers in more than 13 countries. In our cooperation with our suppliers
we strive to create and protect commercial value affected by issues relating to
security, product safety, quality, environmental protection and social responsibility. DFDS’ Group Procurement team aim
to help minimize the risk and maximize
the security of the supply network and
reduce acquisition and administration
costs through working together across the
DFDS Group.
The Group Procurement function is part
of the Finance division of DFDS. Focus
in the sourcing process is on selecting
suppliers with the best fit for the needs
and demands of DFDS. Therefore any
supplier selection process begins with
analysis of our own needs, demands and
requirements. Through a close dialog with
a broad spectrum of suppliers, we assess
the supply base for its cost-effectiveness,
resilience, safety and compliance to regulatory requirements.
On land and at sea, DFDS demands that
suppliers operate in a decent and respectful manner. In the shipping business, for
example, our audit programme checks
that a supplier is on the relevant maritime
authority database as required under the
EU Marine Equipment Directive 1996.
A supplier will achieve the Wheelmark
and be included in the database if it satisfies the criteria. DFDS follows the Global
Ship Management System approach to
check that a supplier meets safety and
environmental requirements, and that
it has achieved its Wheelmark.
Since 2009, the DFDS Supplier Code of
Conduct has been a part of all DFDS’
purchasing and business agreements.
Ultimately, when a contract is signed with
a supplier in our shipping or logistics businesses, the DFDS Supplier Code of Conduct is attached to it. This outlines DFDS’
commitments to applying principles in
business and respecting human rights.

Moving ahead
During 2012 the move towards an integrated purchasing system was put on hold
due to changes in senior management of
the procurement organisation. The development of integrated tools and processes
will therefore be a focus area in 2013
with new management on board. Further
in 2012, Group Procurement welcomed
new members to the team, as part of the
joint venture between DFDS and LD Lines.
Group Procurement is now working out of
Denmark, France, UK, and Lithuania.
In accordance with The DFDS Way, collaboration and engagement are central to
responsible procurement. A major focus
for Group Procurement under 2013 will be
the integration and collaboration across
the whole of the DFDS Group ensuring
continuous improvement and adaptation
of best practices. External support will in
2013 help Group Procurement’s development towards a best in class organization.
In 2011, a new ‘efficient trailer working
group’ was established in our logistics
business. During 2012 the focus of the
group has been to ensure that the policies,
procedures, investments, efficiency and
cost associated with our 3,100 trailers
are consistent and appropriate for DFDS’
needs. Policies for review have been
implemented covering purchase and
disposal, trailer mix, standardisation of
equipment and maintenance. Under 2013
the role out of SERTICA will support this
work further.
