Overview and introduction
The ROCKWOOL Group has always been managed on the basis of values requiring
trustworthy and decent behaviour of the ROCKWOOL Group and its employees. Since an
update in 2010 in connection with the introduction of the new corporate strategy, Rock the
Globe, the values of honesty, entrepreneurship, efficiency, passion and responsibility have
been basic for actions taken in the Group and transactions with our stakeholders including
suppliers and customers.
These values – as interpreted by the ROCKWOOL Group - are further described on the
corporate website.
Conducting our business according to the corporate values is the adequate framework for
the ROCKWOOL Group to conform to modern standards for responsible and reliable
business conduct as well as corporate social responsibility.
The ROCKWOOL Group has a number of Policies and Manuals to secure conformity. All
employees must conform to the conditions covering their employment in the ROCKWOOL
Group – including values and group policies.
On an overall level, the ROCKWOOL Group has for many years expressed its
commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the Group policy on social
responsibility and the Group’s social charter.
All employees and managers are required to ensure that these principles are being
followed.
The Group’s Principles of Leadership and procedures for bilateral conversations between
all managers and subordinates as well as regular, general evaluations of each employee
form the framework which helps ensuring that any misconduct according to these
principles are addressed and that corrective action is taken.

Special development 2012
In accordance with the Danish law on Annual Accounts, art. 99 a., the company must
annually report on its progress within the area on CSR. In addition to the ROCKWOOL
Group’s general CSR policies and measures, this report covers - in each relevant section the special development and initiatives for the year 2012.
New Group HR Senior Vice President and Group Management member
In 2012, Group Management team was changed as a new Group HR Senior Vice
President was hired and joined Group Management. The introduction of a Group HR
function in Group Management reflects the increased focus in the ROCKWOOL Group on
strengthening the general development of the Group’s human resources as well as the
further development and implementation of the value-based management philosophy and
general compliance to Group Policies and management principles.

New framework for our way of working
A new framework – ‘the ROCKWOOL Way’ – was introduced in 2012 and contributes to
the profile of the ROCKWOOL brand and quality standards as perceived by our markets
and stakeholders. The framework is built on our strong values and culture. It is tightly
linked with our leadership principles and high ambitions to foster trust and empowerment.
Together with the Group policy structures, this initiative provides a solid platform for our
way of working.
New whistleblower policy
In 2012, the ROCKWOOL Group introduced a new whistleblower policy. The Group
wishes to ensure continued ethical conduct of its business ethically and in compliance with
the law and has therefore established a policy to encourage reporting of serious breaches
while ensuring the protection of employees reporting such malpractice in the company in
good faith. The reporting of any such concerns and disclosures may be done via an
external law firm.
New audit procedure for suppliers
During 2012, the ROCKWOOL Group’s sourcing and procurement department has
continued the implementation of a new structured supplier evaluation process. In 2012,
this process has been further developed and a formal cooperation between Group
Sourcing and Procurement and Group Audit has been established and an auditing
programme has been introduced. This auditing programme will be further implemented
during 2013. So far, our suppliers have generally been found to comply with our
expectations but one supplier has been instructed to implement improvements with regard
to selected environmental issues.
Increased number of suppliers and larger expenditure under corporate contracts
Both share of suppliers and the total buying expenditure under contract with the
ROCKWOOL Group’s corporate procurement function have increased over the year. Also
the standard contract template has been adjusted and now covers more CSR-related
areas. Under the standard contract with the Group sourcing and procurement function, any
supplier must comply with a set of standardised, international requirements regarding for
example environmental and quality certifications including also the ROCKWOOL Group’s
Code of Conduct for Suppliers which has been made a part of the standard contract
template.
Code of Conduct for Suppliers to be reviewed
As a part of the extension of the supplier control it was decided to review the ROCKWOOL
Group’s Code of Conduct for Suppliers during 2013. The revised Code of Conduct will
have a stronger emphasize on human rights and other CSR-related areas – including
stronger control with the suppliers’ sub-suppliers.

Page 4 of 31

5

Code of Conduct for suppliers – also for local suppliers
In 2012 it was decided to extend the use of the Code of Conduct for Suppliers to also
include suppliers under contracts with local ROCKWOOL affiliates. The implementation of
this will take place during 2013.
Human rights now included in Risk Management System
The ROCKWOOL Group’s Risk Management System has been further developed and
does now also cover human rights and other subjects which potentially could harm the
ROCKWOOL Group’s reputation as a respectable and responsible company. All affiliated
companies must now annually make a self-assessment which must be signed by the
managing director in the relevant company.

Social Charter for the ROCKWOOL Group
In addition, the Group has chosen to further describe its social commitment in the Social
Charter for the ROCKWOOL Group.
The products and services sold by the ROCKWOOL Group have a positive impact on the
global problems of climate change and diminishing reserves of fossil energy. At the same
time they improve the living conditions for millions of people by giving them thermal
comfort, affordable heating and cooling, reduced fire risk, a lower noise and vibration level,
and fewer chemicals in vegetables from greenhouses. These basic, positive contributions
to the world are important for the Group’s employees, for its management and Board and
for the spirit in which we all work.
The fact that the Group offers a positive contribution to the world is also paramount for the
Group’s largest shareholders, the ROCKWOOL Foundation and the Kähler family

Page 5 of 31

6

members. According to its bylaws, the ROCKWOOL Foundation has to spend its entire
earnings to the benefit of society.
Of course the ROCKWOOL Group as a company has to make money in order to develop
the business and offer the shareholders a return on their capital. However, the priorities
should not only be set according to where the Group can make most money; it should also
be ensured that the Group continues to have a positive impact on society in the countries
and on the continents where it operates.
Therefore the Group should continue avoiding being involved in products and in operations
which have a negative impact on people’s health and well-being, and we shall conduct our
business in a way that also ensures a positive social impact on our surroundings.
Conducting the business according to high ethical standards, and training personnel to a
high international level, are typical ways in which the ROCKWOOL Group positively
influences our environment and society - wherever we operate.

General evaluation and expectations for the future
The ROCKWOOL Group’s continuous work with CSR has resulted in several decisions
where the most acknowledged principles for CSR have been applied in connection with
the value based management of our business. Moreover we are confident that the
knowledge of the Group’s values and policies incorporating these principles is strong and
thus used as guidance in all work done in the ROCKWOOL Group. This is also reflected in
our communication with suppliers, customers and other stakeholders.
In the following the ROCKWOOL Group will elaborate on the translation of its Policies into
actions taken with regards to ten of the most widely acknowledged principles of sound
corporate social responsibility.
Relevant policies and sources are listed in connection with each principle. The detailed
contents of many additional policies are developed for internal use only and will not be
publicly available. Any requests about further information concerning the ROCKWOOL
Group’s policies can be directed to the Group Communication department (see

Environment
7. The company should support a precautionary approach to environmental
challenges.
Actions, systems and procedures
Due to the ROCKWOOL Group’s corporate mission and the nature of the
company’s main product area, building insulation, the company is a major
contributor to energy efficiency and thereby reduction of CO 2 emission, thus having
a significant positive influence on the environment by providing sustainable
solutions addressing the many challenges of global climate change. Also the
company’s other products provide major positive environmental advantages such
as e.g. noise reduction and improved indoor climate.
The ROCKWOOL Group has signed the ICC (International Chamber of Commerce)
Business Charter for Sustainable Development. ROCKWOOL has thereby
committed itself to improve environmental performance in accordance with the
Charter’s principles, to have in place management practices to effect such
improvement, to measure progress and to report this progress as appropriate,
internally and externally.
The ROCKWOOL Group has also drawn up a Group Environment Policy. It is
Group policy to either meet or exceed all relevant national and international
environmental standards and legislation.
The Group’s Environment Management System includes safety management and
auditing.
A number of detailed manuals including detailed standards, procedures, audit and
reporting requirements have been established for all relevant production processes.
A number of the ROCKWOOL Group’s production sites are certified according to
the ISO 14001 standard for environmental management.
ROCKWOOL companies have over the years won numerous environmental awards.
Major relevant product groups are subject to evaluation of their environmental
impacts based on a lifecycle assessment (LCA). LCA is a structured study of a
product’s positive and negative environmental impacts throughout its lifecycle: From
extraction and production of resources and raw materials through production to use
and final disposal of the product.
The ROCKWOOL Group’s climate and environmental performance is published
annually in Sustainability Report. The report covers areas like consumption of
energy, raw material, water as well as data on emissions, waste etc. The report also
presents an overview of the company’s social and governance profile.

refurbishments. In order to further explore the potential in recycling, a recycling
scheme has in Denmark been introduced taking back ROCKWOOL renovation and
demolition waste from building sites. All returned stone wool material is re-melted
and turned into new insulation products.

8. The Company should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental
responsibility.
Actions, systems and procedures
Besides the comprehensive existing system for managing and auditing
environmental impacts, the ROCKWOOL Group is constantly developing
improvements of existing systems or new, relevant systems, programmes or
schemes which can help improve the company’s environmental performance or
promote a greater environmental responsibility.
Both the ICC Business Charter for Sustainable Development, the ROCKWOOL
Group’s own environmental policy as well as its social charter promote our
commitment to constantly seeking ways to improve environmental performance.
The Group is a part of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), publicly reporting
according to strict procedures and standards about the company’s CO 2 emission.
The CDP reporting allows the company to benchmark itself against other relevant
players.
The ROCKWOOL Group has defined a general guideline for environmental
assessment of suppliers. This is used to screen existing and potential suppliers in
order to assure that also their environmental performance are taken into
consideration when evaluating the business relationship. This is seen as a tool to
extend The Group’s commitment to improve environmental performance also
outside the company itself.
All suppliers under contract with the Group Procurement function are asked to sign
a declaration to the Code of Conduct for Suppliers for the ROCKWOOL Group
including a commitment to comply with any relevant environmental legislation and in
general to act responsibly towards the environment.
All significant suppliers and contractors under contract with the Group Procurement
function are subject to random checks on environmental performance.

9. The company should encourage the development and diffusion of
environmentally friendly technologies.
Actions, systems and procedures
Being the world’s second largest producer of insulation material which in its lifetime
saves more than 100 times the energy used for its manufacturing and transportation,
the ROCKWOOL Group plays a significant role in developing and diffusion of
environmentally friendly technologies through our sales of insulating systems for
building, industrial and marine and offshore applications.
Given the very energy and capital intensive nature of the ROCKWOOL production
process all production sites and related procedures are audited on efficiency and
environmental performance and global best-practise is deployed.
With regard to the company’s products, a significant amount of resources are
invested in research and development of new technologies that can improve the
energy efficiency in buildings all over the world. Apart from own efforts and
competences engaged in this, the ROCKWOOL Group also works together with a
large number of external partners such as universities and other institutions
involved in research and development in this area.
The Group also plays an active role in informing and working together with
authorities, opinion leaders and political decision makers in order to promote the
best possible framework in terms of public building codes etc. which will motivate a
higher level of energy efficiency in buildings.

Appendix B
Group Policy on business ethics
Guided by the ROCKWOOL Group values, we encourage our employees to build
appropriate relationships with our business partners. With regard to such matters, good
judgment is always required as it is difficult to list rules that can anticipate every possible
situation without being overly prescriptive and harmful to the professional relationship.
However, we must seek an appropriate balance between building and maintaining strong
relationships and ensuring that our professionalism is maintained and our integrity never
impaired.
To help our employees to act accordingly a set of mandatory rules have been
implemented. The most important are summarized below:
-

We always comply with laws, regulations and standards that apply to us in our
professional conduct.

-

We do not give or accept bribes as we strive for fair competition.

-

We do not participate in laundering money from criminal activities. This means we
actively document and trace financial transactions with our business partners.

-

We do not pay criminals for protection but we organise protection of our employees
and assets via legalised and recognised companies when needed.

-

We do not give or receive big gifts of any kind still respecting cultural traditions in the
countries where we operate.

-

All border line situations or deviations to these rules are to be reported to
management in order to ensure a full transparency within the Group.

This appendix is a summary. The full business ethics policy is published on the Group’s
intranet and contains further details which help our employees to act when they are facing
doubtful situations.

Code of Conduct for Suppliers to the ROCKWOOL Group

The ROCKWOOL Group is committed to running its business on ethically and
environmentally-sound principles. We wish to ensure that we act responsibly in
accordance with ethical, legal and international standards of behaviour and we endeavour
to continuously improve our social performance.

Compliance with Applicable Laws and Standards
We expect our suppliers to comply with all international, national and local laws and
standards relating to employment, environmental, purchasing and manufacturing practises.
Employment Practices
The ROCKWOOL Group wishes to ensure that the working practices of our suppliers
towards their employees regarding such issues as equal opportunities, Trade Union
recognition and fair employment terms comply with or exceed national and internationally
accepted standards. We would expect all suppliers to strive towards reducing any potential
risk to their employees and to provide them with safe and healthy working conditions.
Environmental Practices
We would expect our suppliers to comply with the environmental standards and
regulations relevant to their business and to practice sound environmental principles in
their operations.

Development – Principles for Environmental Management”, which identifies
responsibilities, requires an Environmental Officer to be appointed, expects us to have an
Environmental Management System with specific 3 year plans and expects all new
machinery to be environmentally risk assessed before coming into operation. We will
encourage each of our suppliers to follow these principles.
Purchasing Ethics
Employees of the ROCKWOOL Group, irrespective of their position in the organisation, will
not accept any gift from a supplier (either directly or indirectly) that could appear to
influence their decisions on sourcing and contracting issues.
