Corporate Social Responsibility
At Royal Unibrew, corporate social responsibility (CSR) work is an integrated part of our
values and supports our business approach. The CSR efforts are also an important element
in developing the Company‚Äôs brands and maintaining good relations with the Company‚Äôs key
stakeholders.

Royal Unibrew‚Äôs corporate social responsibility work
is based on our values and the ten principles of the
United Nations Global Compact in respect of human
rights, labour standards, environment and anti-corruption. Royal Unibrew has prepared a set of ethical
guidelines providing the overall framework for the
corporate social responsibility work.
The main elements of Royal Unibrew‚Äôs CSR efforts
are as follows:

ROYAL UNIBREW ANNUAL REPORT 2012

Danish Brewers‚Äô Association, in Italy under internal
guidelines consistent with industry norms and in the
Baltic countries by using grown-up models in all advertisements for alcoholic drinks, thus only targeting
the 20+ age group. Moreover, in the Baltic countries
Royal Unibrew has also participated in campaigns
on a balanced diet, healthy life style and responsible
beer consumption.
In addition to complying with marketing legislation
Royal Unibrew complies with a number of ethical
guidelines and takes responsibility for its communication on beer consumption in relation to advertising, sponsorships and campaigns. These guidelines
are included in Royal Unibrew‚Äôs cooperation agreements with customers in Denmark.
Royal Unibrew employees involved in product marketing are regularly instructed and trained in compliance with the rules of the Danish Brewers‚Äô Association, and zero tolerance is pursued with respect to
breaking of the rules. Specifically, this implies that
each incident that might lead to a reprimand in the
Danish Alcohol Advertising Board has direct consequences to the individual Danish employee.
Moreover, Royal Unibrew cooperates with and supQPSUTUIFXPSLQFSGPSNFECZi/BUUFSBWOFOFw	/JHIU

Royal Unibrew also has a responsibility for preventing abuse problems among its employees. Therefore,
Royal Unibrew in Denmark has in 2012 trained a
number of key individuals across the organisation in
supporting colleagues in connection with a potential
over-consumption of alcohol/intoxicants, including
encouraging treatment, and in helping their colleagues get back to work again as easily as possible
following treatment.
Competence development
Royal Unibrew works in a targeted and structured
manner to develop employee competences. These
efforts are further described in the section ‚ÄùOrganisation and employees‚Äù.
Values and ethical guidelines
Royal Unibrew‚Äôs values and ethical guidelines are
included as an integrated part of the employment of
Royal Unibrew people. Our ethical guidelines imply,
among other things, that Royal Unibrew does not tolerate discrimination of its employees due to gender,
race or religion.

Royal Unibrew accedes to the principles of human
rights and labour standards including eg the principles on child labour laid down by Unicef, the UNGC
and Save the Children.
It is also Royal Unibrew‚Äôs aim that suppliers and
partners should comply with the ethical guidelines,
and that these should be incorporated into the Company‚Äôs terms of trading with key suppliers.

Environment
All Royal Unibrew production units focus on continuously limiting the environmental impacts of the
Company‚Äôs production. The result of the various
initiatives in recent years has been a very positive
development in key areas.
Environmental efforts are still primarily targeted at:

The Danish breweries have environmental certification under the ISO14001 environmental standard
and green accounts are prepared for production in
Denmark.
Energy
Energy consumption per unit produced decreased
by 11.7% in 2012 as compared to 2011 to 73 MJ per
hectolitre. This was caused by, among other things,
efficiency improvement and optimisation.
Efforts were directed at reducing energy consumption at the Albani Brewery by improving the rate
of utilisation of the steam boiler plant eg through
energy recycling.

At the Faxe Brewery a structured energy consulting process was carried out in 2012 with a view to
prioritising and implementing energy improvement
projects. Moreover, several projects to reduce water
consumption, heat consumption and electricity consumption were carried out.

Waste water discharge from the Group‚Äôs production
facilities in 2012 was 2.1 hectolitre per hectolitre
output as in 2011. All breweries have strong focus on
implementing efficiency improvements and optimisations and on increasing environmental awareness
among employees.

The heat recovery systems were also optimised,
which contributed towards improving energy ratios
in 2012.

Waste recycling and reduction of
consumption of resources
An important element in improving our environmental results is the minimisation of all types of waste of
resources.

The Kalnapilis Brewery implemented a heat recovery
and energy management system, which has reduced
energy consumption.
Water consumption and waste water discharge
At the Danish breweries water consumption per unit
produced decreased by 10.7% in 2012 as compared
to 2011.
At a section of the Faxe Brewery a system to monitor
cleaning processes was installed in order to optimise the processes. This resulted in water savings
of 12,000 m3 of water or 12.7% in 2012. Experience
from this project is expected to be applied to the
remaining part of the Faxe Brewery and to Royal
Unibrew‚Äôs other breweries in order for water consumption to be further reduced.
Changed rinsing of kieselguhr filters and water recovery in connection with rinsing of cans also had a
large positive effect on water consumption and waste
water discharge at Faxe.

ROYAL UNIBREW ANNUAL REPORT 2012

In 2012 Royal Unibrew focused strongly on wastage
both with respect to production and the other parts
of the supply chain.
The brewery in Faxe focused on increasing the recycling of several products, which implied that value
utilisation has increased and that waste volumes
have been reduced.
Moreover, efforts are continuously directed at reducing the consumption of materials for glass bottles,
cans and plastic bottles.
CO2 neutral production of all Egekilde products
In 2012 the carbon footprint of the Egekilde products
was mapped throughout the chain from raw materials to delivery to Royal Unibrew‚Äôs customers.
The mapping resulted in the launch of the Egekilde
brand as the first Danish CO2-neutral mineral water
product. CO2 neutrality was achieved by investment
in environmentally sound energy through UN- certified carbon credits. At the same time, the weight
of the bottle was reduced, and the plastic contains
up to 50% recycled material. The graphic illustration shows the carbon footprint from production
to consumer, and that subsequent recycling of the
containers may save the environment a large part of
the carbon footprint.
Furthermore, continuous efforts are directed at
reducing energy and resource consumption with
suppliers and within production and logistics.
The launch of the CO2-neutral Egekilde offers
consumers the option of making a climate-friendly
purchasing choice. This is a step in the right direction and in many ways represents Royal Unibrew‚Äôs
approach and assumption of responsibility for the
environment.

Food safety and quality
Royal Unibrew‚Äôs Danish breweries have certification under the international ISO9001 and ISO22000
standards. The efforts within quality and food safety
also comprise requirements from customers and
licensors. In the Baltic countries the breweries have
certification under ISO9001. Also in the Baltic countries, efforts within food safety have been developed
with a view to certification under ISO 22000, and

New intensified quality management requirements
from licensors include traceability and prevention of sabotage. Therefore, efforts were directed at
enhancing the effectiveness of traceability in 2012.
Moreover, testing of new raw materials and packaging materials was extended so as to be implemented
throughout the supply chain to ensure efficiency and
the prevention of errors.
Due to the development and interest in food safety
and quality among consumers, customers and the
media, new ‚Äúcritical‚Äù topics to be addressed by
Royal Unibrew emerge continuously. Royal Unibrew
assesses on a current basis how most appropriately
to take responsibility for preventing risks and how to
communicate this. The priorities set are aligned with
those of industry associations and Royal Unibrew‚Äôs
licensors. Royal Unibrew aims at communicating
openly and honestly and has, as an element in these
efforts, prepared a list of frequently asked questions

Royal Unibrew works against all forms of corruption
including extortion and bribery and the Company‚Äôs
business practice must always be in full compliance with the legislation irrespective of the place of
operation.
According to Royal Unibrew‚Äôs ethical guidelines our
employees are not allowed to offer or accept bribes
or any improper payments for personal or corporate
gain. Disciplinary actions will be taken if an employee is involved in bribery. The sales staff of the Danish organisation and in the malt beverages segment
are trained annually in this aspect.
