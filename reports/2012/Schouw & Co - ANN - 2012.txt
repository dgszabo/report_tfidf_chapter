Corporate
Governance

Corporate social responsibility
Schouw & Co.’s general policy is for all of the
Group’s companies, as a minimum, to comply with
relevant legislation and regulations applying in
the countries and local communities in which they
operate.
In addition, Schouw & Co. generally respects the
ten principles on human rights, labour standards,
the environment and anti-corruption as expressed in
the UN Global Compact. The full wording of the ten
principles is provided on Schouw & Co.’s website,
www.schouw.dk.
It is important to Schouw & Co. that the Group’s
businesses endeavour to comply with the principles
of human rights, labour standards and anti-corruption and that they seek assurance on reasonable
standards when appointing business partners and
suppliers.
Principles regarding the environment may
require that a balance is struck between cost and
effect, but Schouw & Co. believes it is important for
the Group to maintain high standards when it comes
to ensuring reasonable environmental issues and
limiting environmental risks. In addition, the Group
addresses environmental issues from a business
criteria aspect with due consideration for the longterm perspectives and the Group’s good reputation.
Schouw & Co. has implemented its CSR policy in
the Group’s guidelines for its subsidiaries in order to
ensure that the managements of the Group’s businesses are aware of the Group’s general policy on
the matter.
However, Schouw & Co. has not taken any structural initiatives to translate the Group’s policy into
specific action. Accordingly, the Group is unable to
report on results achieved in the 2012 financial year.
