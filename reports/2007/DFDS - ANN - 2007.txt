Emissions

MORE SUSTAINABLE
TRANSPORT

CO2 is the most common greenhouse
gas, and the volume emitted rises or falls
proportionally with fuel consumption. The
most effective manner of reducing CO2
emissions is therefore to reduce the consumption of bunkers per transported unit.
Reduction of bunker consumption
A project to reduce bunker consumption,
launched at the start of 2007, included a
number of technical and operational initiatives, as well as more exact measurement of consumption. Technical initiatives
included, for example, improved engine
efficiency and use of energy, recycling of
excess water and better management of
onboard energy consumption. Operational initiatives included changes to the
ships’ service speeds and the regulation
of departure and arrival times in order to
reduce the service time, which in turn
reduces bunker consumption. In 2007,
reductions in the region of 2–3% per
sailed nautical mile were achieved in
energy consumption, and also therefore
in emissions.
Large-scale operations provide
advantages for the environment
In the longer term, the DFDS fleet will
move towards bigger ships for commercial and environmental considerations.
The concentration of freight volumes on
larger but fewer vessels will reduce energy
consumption and emissions per transported unit.
Sulphur content reduced

Like all other forms of transport, shipping
has an impact on the environment. Ships
are powered by bunkers (fuel oil) that emit
CO2, NOx and particles of sulphur into the
atmosphere when burned. Antifouling
paint can include hazardous heavy metals,
and sewage from vessels can add harmful
nutrients to the marine environment. In
addition, ships can cause noise pollution,
especially while in port. Ballast water in
intercontinental ships can also contain
alien plant and animal species (so-called
“invasive species”).
DFDS’s over-arching goal for its environmental work is to develop the operation of our ships and other activities
towards consumption of less energy
and less impact on the surrounding
environment compared to the transport
capacity.

The amount of sulphur particles emitted by
ships’ engines depends on the volume of
fuel consumed and its sulphur content. In
DFDS’s primary geographic areas of operation, the Baltic Sea and the North Sea,
new international legislation has reduced
the sulphur content of bunkers to 1.5%
compared to the previous level of 4.5%. It
is expected that the move towards bunkers with a lower sulphur content will continue over the next few years.
Antifouling paint
DFDS is in the process of replacing the
fleet’s antifouling paint with a new type of
silicone-based paint. This is not only environmentally friendly, but also reduces the
ships’ friction in the water, so energy consumption, and consequently emissions,
are reduced. The previously used types of
antifouling paints, which contained tin and
emitted environmentally damaging heavy

metals into the marine environment, are
no longer permitted.
Sewage emissions
DFDS’ ships are fitted with biological
cleansing units that biodegrade the sewage generated by onboard water consumption. The sewage is then collected in
tanks and discharged away from coastal
and particularly sensitive marine areas, in
order to put as little strain on the marine
environment as possible. New procedures,
including pumping sewage onshore, are
expected to be introduced as appropriate
units are set up to receive the waste, and
as improved cleansing and storage facilities are developed on new ships.
Ballast water
Ballast water from ships can transfer alien
species (invasive species) from one ecosystem to another, causing an imbalance
in the local marine environment. DFDS’s
ships are not covered by the ballast convention due to their smaller size and as
they mainly operate in marine areas with
closely related ecosystems, the problem
of transferring alien species between different ecosystems must be considered
extremely limited.
Less noise pollution
DFDS is actively making efforts to reduce
noise pollution from ships calling at and
docking in ports in areas with noise-sensitive environments. In particular, work is
being done on technical improvements in
the form of noise insulation for engines
and ramps. Efforts are also being made to
reduce noise by changing routines. In
addition, noise pollution in general will
decrease in the future, as noise reduction
is an important consideration in the construction phase of new tonnage.
Focus on environmental policy
In the second half of 2007, as part of the
Group’s improvement and efficiency programme (the “Go Forward Plan”), a project
was launched to develop a new and more
proactive environmental policy. The new
environmental policy will include all activities, transcending business areas and
countries, so that a high degree of consistency is achieved in the approach to the
work of reducing impact on the environment. The goal is to use environmental
certification to create a dynamic, transparent environmental policy that, on the basis
of quantifiable, objective criteria, will ensure
development towards a more environmentally-sustainable transport company.

HR REPORT

It is of crucial importance to DFDS’s strategic development that the company is,
and is perceived to be, an attractive and
challenging workplace.
With this in mind, an upgrade of the HR
sector was initiated as part of DFDS’s
improvement and efficiency programme
(the “Go Forward Plan”). The current personnel department was thus in 2007
expanded to include an HR-development
function, and a new HR director has been
recruited. In order to embed HR work at
management level and in company strategy, the HR director is also a member of
Executive Management.
Closer co-operation
across the company
As a consequence of DFDS’s new strategy,
“From Routes to Networks”, the business
structure was changed from two divisions
to five business areas. A significant element of this strategy is a greater degree of
exchange and transfer of knowledge and
skills, both between the activities in the
individual business areas and between
the business areas. The objective is to
improve the overall competitiveness of the
route network. As such, an important job
for HR in the future will be to help communicate strategic goals and values about
closer interaction between all parts of
the organisation.

For example, the expanded HR organisation includes four managers who
act as partners to the business areas
in order to implement the strategy’s
goals and values.
Job satisfaction and results
As well as underpinning the strategy’s
goals and values, a primary objective for
HR is to increase staff job satisfaction,
commitment and efficiency. This is
based on the principle that job satisfaction generates positive results, and that
positive results generate job satisfaction.
In addition, the upgrading of HR
reflects the need to adapt to general
development tendencies in the outside
world, including a closer focus on
human-resource management, greater
social responsibility within companies,
and greater influence on one’s own
working conditions.
New initiatives in 2008
Against this background, a number of
new programmes will be introduced
in the first half of 2008:

day level, it is DFDS’ managers that create the framework for a working environment characterised by satisfaction,
efficiency, dialogue and focus on the
development of staff competences. This
presupposes that managers are well
trained in personnel management and
the use of specific management tools.
UÊ Ê ÃÊi>ViiÌÊvÀÊÃÌ>vv\ DFDS is a
service company, and the customer
service provided by staff is crucial to
how customers perceive their experiences of DFDS. A competence-development concept will therefore be introduced across the whole Group in 2008.
The project is designed to guarantee
ongoing improvement and development
of staff competences for the benefit and
pleasure of both individual members of
staff and the company as a whole.
UÊ /
Ê >iÌÊ`iÛi«iÌ\ DFDS’ activities in
16 different countries involve a large
number of valuable and talented individuals, and more focus will now shift
to their development potential. This is
not only the case for management talent, but also, to just as great an extent,
for talents in other professional disciplines. DFDS’ status as an international
company that offers international
careers must be highlighted to a greater extent. The development and implementation of a programme for encouraging talent across the whole organisation will therefore be launched in 2008.

Ê «ÞiiÊÃ>ÌÃv>VÌ\ Parts of the
organisation have regularly conducted and followed up analyses
of employee satisfaction, and subsequently made improvements. In 2008,
this work will be extended to the whole
organisation in order to identify potential improvements in all areas of the
company.

Ê ÀiÛiÌÊvÊÃÌÀiÃÃ\ Stress-prevention
courses will run throughout the organisation before the end of 2008. The
purpose is to give individual members
of staff, managers and departments as
a whole the tools to prevent and deal
with stress. The initial courses were
held in the main office, and will hereafter spread to the rest of the organisation.
UÊ ,
Ê iVÀÕÌiÌ\ Demographic trends
make it highly probable that recruitment will be more competitive in future,
and that attracting trainees and other
younger staff will be more difficult.
DFDS will therefore further refine its
recruitment work, e.g. in educational
institutions, and will also improve the
quality of its in-house vocational training in shipping, finance and travel services. DFDS also plays an active part in
the Danish Shipowners’ Association’s
”Blue Denmark” project, which publicises the opportunities and advantages
of training and working in the shipping
profession as a whole.
