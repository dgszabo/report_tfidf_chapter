Management’s review


Corporate social responsibilityZealand Pharma’s policies with regards to Corporate SocialResponsibility (CSR) cover many areas of our operations.In 2011, Zealand Pharma developed a CSR status reportdescribing the status and activitieswithin the following areas;Labour practices & decent workOccupational health & safetyAnimal rightsEnvironmental sustainabilityAnti-corruption & pharmaceutical ethicsThese focus areas are an amalgamation of existing ZealandPharma values and policies together with the principlesof the United Nations Global Compact where they apply tothe scope of the company’s business. The CSR report givesparticular emphasis to those areas which are unique toZealand Pharma’s business as a biotechnology and researchcorporation with a diverse range of strategic partnerships.However, given that the company does not currentlyhave any marketed or commercialized drugs, there are manyissues specific to the pharmaceutical industry thatconsequently does not fall within the scope of the company’sCSR activities.The complete CSR report can be found on the company’swebsite at:www.zealandpharma.com/investors/csr
