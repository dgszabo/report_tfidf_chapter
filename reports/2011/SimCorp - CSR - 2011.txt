Corporate Social
Responsibility 2011
Statutory corporate social responsibility statement pursuant to
section 99 a of the Danish Financial Statements Act – for the
financial year 2011. This text – Corporate Social
Responsibility in SimCorp 2011 – is an integrated part of the
management report in the SimCorp Annual Report 2011.
1. Letter from the CEO
For individuals and businesses alike, social responsibility is a matter of responsible conduct towards our surroundings,
as everything we do has an effect on other people.
While "saving the planet" is a concern, by far and away the main drivers for SimCorp’s action on corporate social
responsibility are business related. Employee recruitment and retention issues followed closely by cost management are
thus important focus areas. Implementing and preserving sound social responsibility may enhance our attractiveness as
an employer – but equally important, it will also improve the company’s efficiency to the benefit of all stakeholders;
clients, employees and shareholders alike. As a corporation our role in society is to generate a profit, but there is no
obvious conflict between caring for the surroundings and producing strong financial results.
SimCorp does not have a separate CSR policy. This is due to the fact that elements that may be part of a CSR policy are
already integrated elements in SimCorp’s reporting, including the company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, and as
such adopted by the Board of Directors. This statement is thus a summary of information related to questions regarding
corporate responsibility. To us it is a matter of being a responsible citizen, acting with respect for our surroundings; it is
an ingrained part of us – something we have always practised in SimCorp. In fact, this is also reflected in our corporate
values. So, when we say that "we are determined, enthusiastic, and perform with integrity – together", we actually mean
it. It is an approach that pervades the entire business.
Our commitment to sustainable development of SimCorp is based on combining financial performance with socially
responsible behaviour and environmental awareness.

Overall, in the future we aim at maintaining and enhancing our professional relations with internal and external
stakeholders based on mutual respect – for each other and our surroundings.
Peter L. Ravn, CEO

2. Organisational profile
SimCorp is a leading provider of highly specialised software and financial expertise for the financial sector. Established
in 1971, the SimCorp Group has 1,118 employees today located at 20 offices on four continents. Our corporate
headquarters are in Copenhagen, Denmark, where SimCorp A/S is also listed on the NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen A/S
stock exchange.
SimCorp’s software product, SimCorp Dimension, is one of the most comprehensive standard systems of its kind on the
market. Completely flexible, it comes with add-on services and can be configured to support the client’s entire
investment management process. By offering a seamless system platform we can help our clients in the investment
management industry mitigate risk, reduce cost and enable growth. Our clients include financial institutions, asset
managers, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, banks and mortgage lenders, primarily in Europe, North
America and Asia Pacific.

2.1. Employees
In our business, we rely on our employees’ financial expertise and software skills. Approximately 80% of the SimCorp
employees hold an academic degree, most of them within finance, economics, IT or engineering, and we continuously
focus on ongoing training and strengthening knowledge sharing.
SimCorp makes a sustained, targeted effort to continue to attract and retain highly qualified employees. These efforts
include focused management and measurement of employee performance and development of skills to ensure that
competent employees are rewarded and motivated to continuous learning in step with the development of SimCorp’s
business. Employees throughout the entire organisation thus participate in an employee performance review several
times each year to identify and follow up on specific, individual targets related to the company’s general targets. This
enables individual employees to see and understand their own contribution to the company’s performance. It also
enables management to monitor target achievements on an ongoing basis and, if required, adjust efforts.
In addition, SimCorp operates a comprehensive training programme, which aims to efficiently translate general
knowledge into specialised skills and ensure that all employees update and develop their qualifications on a regular
basis. SimCorp considers it important that employees are able to translate their theoretical knowledge into practice in
order to fully utilise skills for the benefit of clients and employees alike. An important feature of SimCorp’s training

programme is the SimCorp Dimension Academy certification programme, which is mandatory for all new SimCorp
Dimension consultants and developers.
All new employees in SimCorp participate in a two-day introduction course instructed by top management and senior
employees. Part of the programme focuses on the SimCorp code of conduct, our values and beliefs and how we do
business. In addition, all SimCorp policies and procedures are available to all employees on the company’s intranet.

2.2. Environment

As SimCorp is committed to proper and diligent conduct in everything we do, we also aim to reduce our environmental
impact in respect for our surroundings. Among other things, we maintain a steady focus on reducing our energy
consumption. Specific measures have already been taken, which include:
Replacing all standard computers with low-energy laptops
Replacing all IT servers with low-energy servers
Installing automatic light and heat adjustment at our corporate headquarters to reduce energy use during off-peak hours
Establishing video equipment at all SimCorp locations to facilitate virtual meetings and hence reduce the need for travel
between subsidiaries
Further, we urge all employees to consider not only their on-the-job energy consumption but also their personal
discharge.
In 2010 we implemented monitoring and measuring of electricity consumption data from all subsidiaries with the
intention of identifying various ways to further reduce use and spending. In 2011 electricity consumption decreased by
4% compared to 2010, while average number of full-time employees decreased by 3%. The decrease is primarily seen
in SimCorp’s company in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Looking ahead, we will continuously look for ways to further reduce environmental impact.

The company’s Board of Directors has self-assessed this report.

4. Governance, Commitments and Engagement
SimCorp’s commitment to sustainable development of our business is based on combining financial performance with
socially responsible behaviour and environmental awareness. It is firmly based on the Group’s core values and
SimCorp’s Corporate Governance Guidelines as adopted by SimCorp’s Board of Directors.

4.1. Board of Directors
As provided in the company’s articles of association, SimCorp’s Board of Directors consists of between three and six
members elected by the company’s shareholders in addition to members elected by and from SimCorp A/S employees.
The Board currently consists of four members elected by the shareholders and two members elected by the employees.
All shareholder-elected board members are regarded as independent, whereas the two employee-elected members are
not regarded as independent due to their employment with SimCorp. Members of SimCorp’s Board of Directors are
elected for one year at a time (employee-elected members for four years).
The composition of the Board of Directors ensures its ability to act as an efficient, visionary and result-oriented
dialogue partner for SimCorp’s Executive Management Board, independent of any special interests, just as it reflects
diversity in terms of age and international experience, among other characteristics. It is part of SimCorp’s
communication policy to pursue an open dialogue with investors and analysts about the company’s business and
financial performance. In order to ensure that SimCorp stakeholders have equal access to corporate information, news is
released to NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen A/S, the media and on SimCorp’s website, where users can also subscribe to
SimCorp’s news service.

4.2. Stakeholder communication
SimCorp wants to maintain an open and ongoing dialogue with stakeholders. We have defined our primary stakeholders
as our clients, our shareholders and our employees. The ongoing dialogue is maintained firstly by keeping an open line
of communication at all times, but also through structured means. One of the methods used by SimCorp is the regular

client satisfaction survey in which SimCorp gauges the clients’ satisfaction with the products and services we provide.
Following the survey, ideas for improvement are discussed and implemented – either generally or with specific clients.
In 2011 SimCorp initiated the implementation of the gauging methodology "Net Promoter Score" (NPS) that will
provide SimCorp an instant measure of client satisfaction. SimCorp continually strives to improve client satisfaction in
all of its doings and believes that going forward it will become an even more important part of SimCorp’s company
culture.
Internally, SimCorp prides itself on having an open and straightforward dialogue among its employees – regardless of
age and rank. In addition to the less formalised communication, all SimCorp employees world-wide are invited to take
part in an employee survey. The survey focuses on overall job satisfaction and engagement. SimCorp’s next employee
survey will be run in spring of 2012.
In addition to the dialogue with the above stakeholders, SimCorp A/S maintains membership of various industry
associations, including Dansk Industri (The Confederation of Danish Industry), IT Brancheforeningen (the IT trade
organisation) and Center for Ledelse (Danish Centre for Leadership) but SimCorp as a company does not engage in any
political or societal relations, nor does it support any political party.

4.3. Whistleblower policy
SimCorp has established a whistleblower system as a means of increasing our focus on transparency. The whistleblower
system allows employees, management and members of the Board of Directors of SimCorp who believe they have
become aware of actions or omissions that could damage SimCorp whether financially, reputationally or in some other
way to pass on this information to a whistleblower e-mail account.
The Board of Directors has appointed a representative of SimCorp, who possesses the professional qualifications and
integrity in order to provide for a credible and reasonably independent administration of the whistleblower policy, to act
as gatekeeper in respect of the whistleblower account.
Any information received via the whistleblower system and which by the gatekeeper is not considered clearly unfounded will be passed on to the CEO and the Chairman of the Board of Directors who will then consider the
appropriate measures. Reports and questions that are received via the whistleblower system are treated confidentially.

4.4. The SimCorp Organisation
SimCorp’s Executive Management Board is responsible for the day-to-day management of the company and currently
consists of four members. The Executive Management Board reports to the Board of Directors, which is elected directly
by the SimCorp shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Two members of the Board of Directors are elected for a
four-year-period by and among SimCorp’s employees in Denmark.
