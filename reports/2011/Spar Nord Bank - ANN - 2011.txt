ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT AND ENGAGEMENT SPAR NORD’S SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
FOCUS AND MEASUREMENT

SPAR NORD’S PRINCIPLES
•

Our engagement is business-driven the measures we implement must contribute
to our business.

•

Our engagement is the sum of local
initiatives - we work to give something back
to the local communities in which we operate.

•

Our active involvement and engagement are
well considered - we operate and put the
main emphasis on one project at a time.

•

Our active involvement and engagement
are focused - we would rather do one thing
with single-minded purpose than two things
halfway.

•

Our engagement is dynamic – we evolve
and scale over time.

Corporate Social Responsibility, or CSR, is something we take seriously at Spar Nord. However, we prefer to translate this fashionable
term into our own language and reality because experience shows
that this produces better defined and more focused action.
At Spar Nord we have therefore grouped our initiatives and activities
relating to social responsibility under the heading of “Active involvement and engagement”.
Active involvement and engagement relate to very specific behaviour, not abstract principles. We believe that our responsibility as a
company and a financial institution is anchored in close involvement
with customers and the local community. A responsibility and an involvement that are embedded as given elements in our history and
culture and on which our business depends.
Active involvement and engagement imply a purely physical proximity and at the same time a receptiveness and attentiveness. Both
aspects are pivotal to Spar Nord. All our business builds on local
decision-making, local presence and active participation in the local
community. We also take pride in placing the customer first, thereby
showing engagement in the advice we give.
And our attitude of active involvement and engagement also manifests itself internally. We listen to our employees and are not afraid
to publish the results in our Performance & Job Satisfaction Statement. We also listen to ourselves, continuously reflecting on our
market conduct and on where our involvement can best benefit both
the community and Spar Nord. Engagement, as an intrinsic part of
everything we do, is therefore one of our core values.

42 Spar Nord Bank

To focus our active involvement and engagement and make those
efforts tangible and measurable, we continually focus on special
aspects of active involvement and engagement in our business and
our social responsibility approach. We believe the best results are
obtained by focusing on one thing at a time. This also means that our
responsibility has evolved over time. This helps ensure that new actions rest on strong foundations and result in lasting improvements.
The annual theme topics we choose to particularly focus on are introduced in our Performance & Job Satisfaction Statement, in which
we continuously measure a series of customer, employee and market-related issues. This way we ensure that words and headings are
translated into concrete action and tangible improvements for all
parties involved. The Performance & Job Satisfaction Statement is
systematically expanded over time to include new action areas.

INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES
Spar Nord supports the Danish Government’s endeavours to put
Corporate Social Responsibility at the top of the agenda, and we also
support the intentions underpinning international initiatives like the
UN Global Compact and UN PRI. Nevertheless, we have chosen not
to formally commit ourselves to the two UN reporting initiatives.
This decision should be viewed in light of the fact that we already
endeavour to abide by the principles, and also that our activities are
very locally slanted. Thus, in our assessment we could put our resources to better use if we channel them into other activities than
spending them on reporting to the UN.

GENDER & CAREER
Since 2010, the theme topic “Gender & Career” has been the special focus area selected. This particular theme topic was chosen because people have discussed for decades how gender equality leads
to better business. Thus, the theme topic Gender & Career harmonizes with the ideal of business-driven social responsibility, its purpose being to promote gender equality, to maximize talent potential
regardless of gender, and to create an even better match between
the Bank’s customers and the staff and executives who advise them.
Spar Nord’s commercial target group consists of ordinary retail customers and local businesses. It is desirable therefore for the Bank to
have a broad composition at both non-executive and executive level.
In terms of gender this means that the Bank has an aim of being an
attractive workplace for both men and women, one where harmonious interaction exists between working life and private life.
Recognizing that the current reality does not match the Bank’s goals
and intentions, Spar Nord has launched a targeted action aimed at
increasing the number of women in executive positions. Gender &
Career has therefore been designated a joint action area for the
Group as a whole, and a theme under which both central and local
actions will be initiated.

TARGETS AND FOLLOW-UP INITIATIVES
The purpose of the Gender & Career initiative is to improve Spar
Nord’s ability to activate the human and leadership resources within
its work force, and specifically therefore to ensure equal career opportunities in the Group for both sexes.
The primary goal is to interest more women in an executive career
with the Spar Nord Group. Another key objective is, for both sexes, to
improve the retention of executives by balancing career with recreation and family life.
In concrete terms, the goal has been formulated thus:
•

•

In 2011, there should be at least three qualified applicants
for executive positions at the Bank, and in 2012 there
should be at least five - at least one of whom should be
a woman.
In the long term, the number of women attending the
Pitstop management course should be at least 50%.

In addition to these goals, we also continually follow the distribution
of gender at executive and mid-level executive level. We also carry
out job satisfaction and performance analyses, broken down by gender, in a number of specific areas:
•
•
•
•
•

Barriers to creating the desired career
Potential for creating good balance between work
and family life
Benefit from staff performance appraisals
Feedback and follow-up from an employee’s
immediate manager
Satisfaction with development potential

ACTION AREAS
Highlights among the initiatives implemented in 2011:
•
•
•
•
•

Launch of a job bank for employees interested in a career
as an executive
Development and launching of an experience forum/
mentor programme targeted at executive talents

Still far more men than women express a wish to embark on an
executive career. In response to the statement “I am interested in
becoming a manager within the next 0-3 years”, 22% of the male
respondents said that they agree strongly, compared to only 8% of
the female respondents. However, both men and women showed
significant progress since the last survey in 2009, when 11% of the
men and 3% of the women declared that they agreed.

In 2011, vacancies for five executive and eight middle manager positions were advertised. Women constituted half of the in-house
applicants for the executive positions and 25% of those for middle
manager positions.
In the Pitstop programme completed in 2011, two out of the 16
participants who successfully completed the course were women.
Another team will start on a new course programme in 2012, and
among the applicants there were 62% men and 38% women.

RESULTS FROM PERFORMANCE & JOB SATISFACTION
The customer survey in our Performance & Job Satisfaction Statement for the year shows growing customer satisfaction, unchanged
customer loyalty and highly satisfactory progress in customers’ asSpar Nord Bank 43

sessment of Spar Nord’s reputation and credibility. The more specific results of the survey show that the key parameters for customer
satisfaction and loyalty are the frequency and quality of the dialogue
with the banking adviser and the Bank’s general reputation.

The employee survey shows major progress as concerns both job
satisfaction and how performance is experienced. Employees increasingly feel that the initiatives implemented to boost efficiency
are yielding more time for customer contact, that central initiatives
in the chain are well coordinated and of good quality, and that the
Bank has a good reputation both nationally and locally.
