Corporate social responsibility at Bang & Olufsen
This section represents Bang & Olufsen's statutory reporting on CSR pursuant
to section 99a of the Danish Financial Statements Act (Årsregnskabsloven).
An extract from it can be found in the company's 2011/12 annual report.
Business-driven CSR
The Bang & Olufsen logo is a guarantee of quality, which it has been since the
inception of the company in 1925. This not only applies to providing highquality products to customers, but also in relation to the way of conducting
business.
Naturally, Bang & Olufsen recognises the UN and ILO declarations on human
rights, labour rights, the environment and anti-corruption, for which reason we
have chosen to structure our CSR work and reporting according to the UN's
Global Compact.
In 2012/13, Bang & Olufsen intends to undertake new activities to strengthen
the CSR efforts: Initiation of independent external supplier audits,
assessments of the need for tier 2 supplier assessments, expansion of the
company's internal code of ethics to include the sales organisation,
establishment of a whistleblowing function.
Bang & Olufsen's CSR policy
In order to formalise and elucidate the CSR principles followed by the
company, Bang & Olufsen adopted a CSR policy in 2011/12.
The CSR policy underlines that Bang & Olufsen wants to be a reliable and
ethical responsible business partner to suppliers and other stakeholders. The
company will contribute to improve people’s conditions and provide its
employees with a framework that will motivate them and give them a sound
working environment, and it wants to show concern for the environment, both
in its own activities and in the footprint left by the products in a life-cycle
perspective. Within its sphere of influence, the company is willing to assume a
share in the responsibility for a sustainable global development.
Bang & Olufsen's CSR policy covers all business units and facilities in the
group, and the company strives to ensure that suppliers and other business
partners act in accordance with the intentions of the policy.
In line with the UN's Global Compact, our CSR policy is divided into four main
areas: human rights, labour rights, the environment and anti-corruption.
CSR efforts
Bang & Olufsen has a systematic approach to CSR and is certified according
to ISO 9001 (quality management), TS16949 (technical standard for quality in
the automotive industry), ISO 14001 (environmental management) and
OHSAS 18001 (occupational health and safety management). The
management systems contribute to focusing the work on the areas with the
greatest potential for improvement.

The 2011/12 adoption of a CSR policy ensures that efforts within human
rights, labour rights and anti-corruption are prioritised on the same terms as
the other focus areas
The CSR work covers four important focus areas:





Minimisation of the impact on the external environment through
process optimisation, e.g. reduction of the energy consumption and
waste volumes at the facilities.
Environmental improvements through product development, including
reduction of the products' electricity consumption and enhanced
possibilities of recycling components.
Improvement of occupational health and safety, e.g. by reducing the
number and severity of industrial injuries.
Safeguarding of human and labour rights for the employees of the
component suppliers, which are primarily located in Asia.

To support its CSR policy, Bang & Olufsen has implemented a code of
conduct for suppliers setting out the company's values in key areas such as
the environment, human rights, labour rights and anti-corruption so that they
are clearly communicated to suppliers and other stakeholders.
Finally, the company has implemented an internal code of ethics with
guidelines for, among other things, the exchange of gifts, negotiation principles
and conflicts of interest.
Group targets and results
The adoption of a CSR policy for the entire Group was a significant result in
2011/12. Good results were also achieved within the areas of environment and
work environment even though all formal targets were not achieved.
In 2011/12, four CSR targets for the group were set up. They all related to the
environment and occupational health and safety, as these areas are of
particular relevance in an electronics company.

In 2012/13 Bang & Olufsen continues improving the work environment and
reducing environmental impact of the company’s activities. The company
expects to establish a whistleblowing function in 2012/13.
Human and labour rights
Bang & Olufsen strives in all matters within the group's control to support and
respect the protection of internationally declared human rights.
Bang & Olufsen endeavours to display corporate social responsibility of the
highest level in relation to its own employees and working conditions at the
company's suppliers. It goes without saying that Bang & Olufsen supports the
abolition of child labour and forced labour, as well as dissociating itself from
workplace discrimination.
Bang & Olufsen attaches great importance to freedom of association and
recognises the right to negotiate collectively. The company wants to be an
accommodating workplace in which the individual employee thrives and has
the chance to develop and establish a good work-life balance.
Responsible supplier control
Bang & Olufsen's most important work in relation to human and labour rights is
done in collaboration with the company's suppliers. Bang & Olufsen works
actively to ensure that, for example, no suppliers use child labour or forced
labour, or generate unnecessary environmental impact during the production
of materials for Bang & Olufsen.
As part of its work on responsible supplier control, Bang & Olufsen has drawn
up a code of conduct setting out the company's values in key areas such as
the environment and climate, human rights, labour rights and anti-corruption
so that they are clearly communicated to suppliers and other stakeholders.
All Bang & Olufsen's direct suppliers must sign the Code of Conduct and with
it the requirements that Bang & Olufsen expects each and every supplier to

3

Bang & Olufsen
CSR reporting 2012

1 August 2012

live up to. At the same time, by signing the document, the direct suppliers
must ensure that their suppliers, in turn, abide by the same guidelines and
regulations.
A risk analysis of Bang & Olufsen's suppliers is carried out once a year and
the results are used to focus attention on suppliers considered at risk of
breaching the company's Code of Conduct. The risk is assessed on the basis
of local conditions in the supplier's home country, among other things. Such
suppliers can subsequently expect to be subjected to an audit intended to
identify opportunities for improving conditions, if necessary. In recent years,
audits have been carried out by Bang & Olufsen's own purchasing
organisation, which also assesses suppliers' CSR in day-to-day cooperation.
This ensures an immediate response to any conspicuous problems.
In 2012/13, audits will be carried out in collaboration with external,
independent auditors specialising in CSR. All new suppliers in high-risk
countries, e.g. Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe, will undergo an external
audit. An assessment will also be made in the course of the year as to whether
there is a need to audit Bang & Olufsen's suppliers higher up the value chain.
It is not the intention to use supplier control to break off cooperation with the
supplier if an audit reveals critical irregularities. Instead, the company will
initiate cooperation on action plans aimed at improving the supplier's
environmental and social standards.
Working environment
Bang & Olufsen wants to create a safe and healthy working environment for its
employees with the emphasis on both the physical and psychological working
environments.
Bang & Olufsen's Danish activities received OHSAS 18001 certification in
2010, and the three external audits that have been carried out did not give rise
to any nonconformities. One external audit has been completed in 2011/12.
Working environment is incorporated in the product right from the design and
development phase, as the choices made by the product developer often have
a major impact on working environment in the production phase, including
materials, assembly methods and surface treatment.
Risk assessments are carried out for new equipment, new processes and
production changes prior to implementation so as to minimise the risk of
accidents, while action plans are drawn up for areas for improvement,
ensuring, among other things, that all new recruits and employees who
change job within the company are introduced to the working environment and
environment. Close calls are recorded and analysed so as to reduce the risks
of future accidents as much as possible.

Eleven industrial injuries were recorded in 2011/12, equivalent to a frequency
of 4.3. The target was a frequency of 3.5 or less. In terms of the number of
injuries, the target was exceeded by two injuries. In 2010/11, the number of
industrial injuries were 14 with a frequency of 5.3.
The seriousness of the injuries in terms of hours of absence per 1,000 working
hours (severity) also fell in relation to the previous year, and the target of
severity of 0.154 or less was achieved with a figure of 0.095. We did not
succeed in meeting the target for number of injuries in 2011/12, but there was
a reduction in the number of days of absence per injury.
The diagram shows changes in the number of injuries and frequency.
The target is based on frequency, which is the number of injuries per 1 million working
hours and therefore unaffected by the number of employees.

course continuing. Group targets for the working environment will be set in
2012/13 too.
Environment
The environment is of particular importance as a CSR target area for Bang &
Olufsen, and it is divided into product environment and external environment.
Product environment encompasses the environmental issues linked to the
company's products, such as electricity consumption in the use phase.
External environment encompasses the environmental issues linked to the
company's own production, such as waste and consumption of raw materials,
electricity, heat and water.
Work is constantly being done to find holistic and sustainable solutions so as
to ensure that considerations regarding the features, design and life of our
products are in balance with impact on the environment. When our products
are eventually disposed of, it must be possible to recycle as much of them as
possible for use in a new life cycle.
Bang & Olufsen's Danish activities received ISO 14001 certification in 2010,
and the three external audits that have been carried out did not give rise to
any nonconformities. One external audit was completed in 2011/12.
The main issues in terms of the external environment are energy consumption
and waste from production. The main product-related environmental issue is
electricity consumption in the use phase.
Bang & Olufsen makes products with a long life, which contributes to lower
resource consumption in general and less waste than in the case of products
with a short life. Their design is timeless, and many homes have Bang &
Olufsen products that are 20 or 30 years old. On average, a Bang & Olufsen
product has a life of 10-15 years without any deterioration in sound or picture
quality. Bang & Olufsen supplies spare parts for its products for up to 12 years
after a product is last made. Older Bang & Olufsen products also remain in
great demand, and the market for used Bang & Olufsen products is relatively
large, which helps to further strengthen the Bang & Olufsen brand as offering
sought-after products that last.
External environment
It is important to Bang & Olufsen that pollution from the company's activities
should be kept to an absolute minimum and that production should not cause
any nuisance for neighbours. There is therefore an ongoing emphasis on both
new projects and follow-up on existing buildings and activities. The company
always enters into a dialogue with the regulatory authorities with a view to
finding the best solutions and thereby limiting pollution as much as possible.
Environmental approval under Part 5 of the Danish Environmental Protection
Act (Miljøbeskyttelsesloven) is required for just a single Bang & Olufsen
factory, which is located in Struer. The environmental approval was re-audited
in 2010 and is not due to be audited again until 2020. The environmental
approval relates to surface treatment and mechanical processing of
aluminium. A licence has also been granted to discharge process waste water
to a purification plant belonging to the factory.

There were no operating accidents in 2011/12, nor did Bang & Olufsen receive
any complaints from neighbours.
One group target was set for energy consumption in production and
one group target was set for the recyclability of Bang & Olufsen's waste.

There was a marked reduction in total energy consumption. Energy
consumption fell both nominally and relative to production volume. The
savings were achieved by, among other things, setting up what are called
BEOenergy groups among the employees, who work in a targeted way to
reduce energy consumption. The BEOenergy project helps to change
employees' habits when using tools and office machines, and, together with
concrete initiatives such as energy optimisation for production
machinery/closing times and buildings, helped Bang & Olufsen reduce energy
consumption by 10% when its target had been 5%.

Climate and CO2
For the last 5 years, Bang & Olufsen has reported to the Carbon Disclosure
Project, which collects information on behalf of various investors regarding the
work being done by listed companies to reduce carbon emissions. Targets and
activities in this area are described in the sections on the external environment
and product environment.
Waste from production
Bang & Olufsen cooperates actively with the company's waste buyers with a
view to further optimising waste sorting at the factories so as to increase the
amount of waste being recycled rather than recovered.
The following diagram shows a substantial increase in the recycling rate in
2011/12 from 74% to 78%. This represents 877 tonnes of the company's total
waste of 1,125 tonnes being recycled.

Product environment
Bang & Olufsen incorporates environmental considerations in the life cycle of
its products by setting comprehensive environmental requirements for
products right from the product development phase.
They are called mandatory requirements and ensure compliance with
European directives and other legislation, including RoHS, WEEE, the Battery
Directive, the Packaging Directive and various labelling schemes. In this way,
Bang & Olufsen knows that the products leaving the factory comply with local
legislation on all the markets where Bang & Olufsen sells products.
Electricity consumption in use phase
Electricity consumption in the use phase is a significant environmental issue

8

Bang & Olufsen
CSR reporting 2012

1 August 2012

and is made up of a product's standby electricity consumption and electricity
consumption when the product is in use (on mode). Bang & Olufsen's
televisions automatically turn themselves off after four hours of inactivity. The
results of life cycle analyses for Bang & Olufsen's products show that the
greatest environmental impact is energy consumption in the customer's home.
This has made it natural for Bang & Olufsen to focus its environmental efforts
on, among other things, reducing standby consumption, which can be
regarded as pure waste.
The following diagram shows the total annual electricity consumption for all
Bang & Olufsen products sold in the 2011/12 financial year and the average
electricity consumption per product. Both total electricity consumption and
electricity consumption per product have fallen in the last 2 financial years.
This is partly because newer television models have been upgraded with new
technology, but also because the product mix has changed owing to the
successful launch of the new, smaller products in the B&O Play range.

Bang & Olufsen ICEpower
Bang & Olufsen's products mainly use energy-efficient amplifiers from Bang &
Olufsen ICEpower. In ordinary amplifiers, only about 20% of the input power is
converted to output power. The remaining 80% is converted into heat. That is
why amplifiers normally have large cooling fins to disperse the heat.
In normal use, Bang & Olufsen ICEpower reduces power consumption by
70%. In addition to Bang & Olufsen ICEpower amplifiers reducing power
consumption when the unit is on, resource consumption is also reduced, as
materials do not have to be used for large cooling fins.
Disposal of worn-out products
Electronic scrap is a valuable source for recycling raw materials if it is

9

Bang & Olufsen
CSR reporting 2012

1 August 2012

processed correctly. In much of the world, worn-out electrical and electronic
products have to be collected and processed by an approved waste handler.
The product is separated into different material fractions – metal, PCBs,
plastic, glass and screens – which are then used to make new raw materials.
As far as possible, the materials that cannot be recycled are sent for
incineration, with the energy being recovered.
Bang & Olufsen also gives thought to disposal when it designs new products.
For example, all plastic components are labelled so that waste handlers can
identify the type of plastic involved.
The European Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE)
requires at least 65% of all entertainment electronics collected to be
recyclable, and it has to be possible to make use of a further 10% by means of
incineration with energy recovery. Although the manufacturers are not directly
responsible for ensuring this, when Bang & Olufsen develops new products, it
has a dismantling test carried out to show how the product will be stripped
down at disposal, what material fractions the product consists of and how
much of the product can be recycled. Suggestions are also made for design
improvements that could be used in future products. These dismantling tests
show that between 75% and 86% of the material components in Bang &
Olufsen's televisions can be recycled.
The figure below shows recycling and energy recovery for some of Bang &
Olufsen's products.

Ethics and anti-corruption
The group strongly dissociates itself from all forms of corruption, including
extortion and bribery.
In 2011/12, Bang & Olufsen adopted a CSR policy, which also includes anticorruption but since 2005 the company has had a clear and formal code of
ethics with guidelines for e.g. exchange of gifts, negotiation principles and
conflicts of interes. In 2011/12, formal Group targets were not set but during
2011/12, the company has evaluated the need to update the code of ethics to
extend the use in the organisation and a formal basis for decision is being
prepared. During 2012/13 a whistleblowing function is expected to be
established.
