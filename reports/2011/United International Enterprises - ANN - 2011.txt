Corporate Social Responsibility
Since its foundation, UIE has invested in the agro-industrial sector, particularly palm oil.
Investing in companies that depend on natural resources means that we have an inherited
interest to act in environmentally and socially responsible manners, and thereby secure the
long-term basis for our business.
As a listed investment holding company, we strive to attain acceptable long-term returns,
while maintaining the important balance between economy and care. We believe that
the best way to do this is to invest in companies that are operated and developed in an
environmentally and socially responsible manner.
We support the implementation of corporate social responsibility in our associated
companies by close dialogue with the management on strategic and operational issues, and
we expect our associated companies to:
•

Protect the environment and natural resources by applying environmentally responsible
production methods.

•

Secure the well-being of their employees by providing good and safe working
conditions.

•

Uphold human rights and be responsible members of the communities they are part of.

To have true impact, UIE believes that corporate social responsibility should be carried out
locally and in ways suited to meet the actual needs on ground. Thus, to allow for such
flexibility, the environmental and social aspects, relevant for our associated companies, are
addressed individually in their CSR policies. A detailed account of our associated companies’
CSR commitments can be found in their annual reports, sustainability reports and on their
websites.
The following CSR ‘highlights’ from the associated companies’ CSR policies clearly illustrate
that corporate social responsibility is an integrated part of these companies’ core businesses.

UP:
UP’s Corporate Social Responsibility policy focuses on continuous care, commitment and
responsibility towards its employees, the environment, the community and the marketplace
in which it operates. UP remains committed to conducting business in a manner that
achieves sustainable growth while maintaining a high degree of social and environmental
responsibility. In 2010 a CSR sub-committee was established (an extension to the existing
Environment Management Committee) to formalize and take charge of necessary and
relevant CSR topics.
Environmental commitments
•

UP is committed to continuously reducing the environmental impact of its operations
by implementing new and greener technologies.

•

UP was the fi rst producer of palm oil in the world to obtain certification for sustainable
palm oil production in accordance with the Principles and Criteria of the Roundtable
on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Since UP’s certification a total of 29 companies have
obtained RSPO certification. In 2011 the Indonesian Government implemented a
mandatory certification scheme called the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil Principles
& Criteria (IRSPO) to make sure that all producers in Indonesia within a few years
comply with the scheme.

•

In December 2010 UP’s refi nery in Malaysia, Unitata, received its RSPO Supply Chain
Certification and is thereby able to handle and deliver fi rst class sustainably certified
and segregated palm and palm kernel oil solutions to customers worldwide.

•

In October 2011, UP reaped the benefits of their work on CSR, as the Company was
presented with the prize for the best CSR practice in Malaysia. The prize is based on
companies’ contribution to and positive impact on the employees, environment and
local communities as a whole (please see page 50 for a further description). Only two
months later in December, UP was presented with yet another prize the National
Excellent Occupational Safety and Health Award 2011 (Agricultural Category). The
winner is selected by the Malaysian Working Environment Authority based on criteria
like implementation of safety and health measures, employee participation, safety
control, safe handling of chemicals and continuous improvement of safety and health
standards.

•

In 2006, UP inaugurated the world’s fi rst fully integrated plantation-based biomass
boiler and biogas plant, and has since constructed three biogas plants. Combined,
these four plants have reduced the emission of CO2 by 70% and CH4 by 80% at the
respective operating units. In addition the plants have all been certified as Clean
Development Mechanism Projects (CDM). In addition the construction of a biogas
plant, the fi rst of its kind in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, has commenced, and it is
expected to be commissioned by or before February 2013.

•

In 2008, the world’s fi rst comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), in accordance
with the ISO 14040 and 14044 International Standards, was conducted in UP, covering
the entire palm oil production chain. The LCA was renewed in 2010 and again in
May 2011. The 2011 LCA provided UP with a comprehensive and clear overview of
the company’s efforts to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade, and helped
to identify areas where further improvements could be made. When compared to the
2005 levels, the LCA shows that the current four CDM projects will help reduce the
annual emissions of Green House Gasses by a minimum of 125,000 MT CO2 (eq) and
thereby the company will meet its target of reducing the carbon footprint per ton of
refi ned palm oil produced by 35% by 2012.

•

Today, all of UP’s palm oil mills are self-sufficient with energy and produce steam and
electricity used elsewhere in the operations.

•

UP is continuously working towards a dynamic and innovative waste management
and utilization system aimed at achieving zero waste. The programme includes among
others:
•
•
•

48

Harvesting rain water.
Monitoring domestic water consumption at all facilities.
Recycling biomass residue from field and mill operations as organic matter or as
fuel source to enrich the soil and reduce the use of fossil fuels. In 2011 the total
organic matter recycled on land in UP amounted to 538,670 tonnes with a carbon
content of 215,468 tonnes.

UP: UP has three biogas plants
in Malaysia and construction of a fourth biogas plant
is currently underway in
Indonesia. The plant depicted
below is located in connection
with the palm oil mill at UIE
(M) Estate. The biogas plants
convert palm oil mill effluent
into biogas and thereby mitigating methane emissions by
approximately 80%.

UP is committed to increase the use of eco-friendly and natural insecticides in the
plantations to phase out or reduce the use of pesticides. For many years, UP has been
working towards minimizing the use of pesticides via implementing the following key
components of its Integrated Pest Management Programme (IPM):
•

•
•

•

•

Planting beneficial plants to enhance the natural parasitic and predator activities
against bagworm and other pests. Over the past five years the number of beneficial
plants has increased five-fold and to-date more than 138,000 beneficial flowering
plants have been planted.
Pheromone traps for biological control of rhinoceros beetle.
Installation of barn owl boxes to attract barn owls which are used as a fi rst line
defence against the damaging rat population in the plantations. A pair of barn
owls can consume up to 800 rats per year, and as there are approximately 2,000
pairs of barn owls at the estates, they consume approx. 1.5 million rats per year.
This has reduced the pesticides used to fight the rat population significantly.
On-going monitoring and areal surveillance is carried out to better detect, preempt and treat potential pest outbreaks before they become too serious (treatment
is only carried out when the damage exceeds established critical thresholds).
First line of treatment against leaf pests is by biological treatment in the form of
Bacillus Thuringiensis.

Today, UP’s use of pesticide is 6-8 times lower per tonne of produced oil compared to
Rapeseed farmers, and about 45-50 times lower compared to Soybean Oil farmers.
•

More than 5,500 hectares have been set aside for conservation purposes (jungle
reserves, wildlife sanctuaries and green corridors) to encourage biodiversity and
wildlife on UP’s estates (representing approximately 10% of UP’s total planted area. In
Indonesia, preserved jungle areas constitute approximately 35% of UP’s total area.

•

To develop effective conservation strategies UP and the Copenhagen Zoo entered into
a formal partnership. On 1 October 2010 a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
was signed between the two parties. The MoU included establishing a Biodiversity
Department as part of the Lada Estate field office in Indonesia. In September 2011 the
Department was officially opened. The Department has identified and made a list of
environmental, mapping and social challenges, and they have made proposals on how
to address and overcome the challenges. This work has commenced with focus on the
following main areas:
•
•
•
•
•

•

Biodiversity and baseline information
Geographic Information System (GIS) and mapping
Forestry and rehabilitation
Communication and mainstreaming
Integration into standard operation practices

The endangered tree species reserve established in 2008, continues to expand and
to date a total of 9,500 tropical trees from about 200 diverse tree species have been
planted. This will become a valuable source of seeds that will be used to establish
additional areas with these endangered trees and thereby create a true biodiversity of
tree species.

United Plantations awarded Malaysian CSR prize
In October 2011, United Plantations reaped the benefits of their hard work on CSR, as the Company was presented
with the prize for the best CSR practice in Malaysia. The prize is based on companies’ contribution to and positive
impact on the employees, environment and local communities as a whole.
The prize was presented by the Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister on the Malaysia
International Commodity Conference & Showcase. The conference is held every
second year and is the largest of its kind in Malaysia.
”Two years ago we were rewarded for running the most efficient plantation in Malaysia.
Being awarded the CSR prize this year (2011) is, in my opinion, a clear evidence of our holistic
approach to sustainability. Financial sustainability is, without a doubt, part and parcel of our
impact on the employees, the environment and the surrounding communities. We build on
a tradition that has been United Plantations’ cornerstone for generations”, says Executive
Director of United Plantations Dato’ Carl Bek-Nielsen.

Social and community responsibility

UP: Annual sports days are
held at selected estates. This
picture is from the Merdeka
Sports Carnival at UIE (M)
Estate.
UP: UP has set aside about
35% of its land bank in
Indonesia as permanent conservation areas.

•

Social responsibility and community engagement have been the hallmark of UP
throughout its history and UP strives to be a trusted corporate citizen, and as an
integral part of society, to fulfi l its responsibilities to the society and community in
which it operates.

•

The social commitment and welfare programmes of UP include well-equipped
hospitals and health clinics, premium housing for employees and families, places of
worship such as temples, mosques and churches, kindergartens, primary schools and
old folks homes for the company’s retirees, etc.

•

As families, small businesses and organisations grow out of UP’s operations and
become dependant on UP, close bonds with the local communities become UP’s key
priority. UP therefore supports charitable organisations caring for the local communities
and society at large such as the Bethany Home which is a training centre for epileptic
& intellectually disabled children and adults. Furthermore, UP took the initiative to
start up the Smallholders Field Day. Farmers from the local districts are invited to the
plantation to get a better understanding of good agricultural practices. They are trained
in safe handling of pesticides, optimal harvesting procedures and fertilizer application.
The programme will steer the farmers away from illegal logging, slash-and-burn
activities etc. and thus help turn this negative impact on the environment around.

•

Occupational Health and Safety is a fundamental part of all UP’s operations. The
Health and Safety measures include periodic workplace inspections, regular Safety
Committee meetings, regular medical surveillance, awareness raising and training
programmes in proper use of personal protective equipment.

AAK:
AAK fi nds it important to anchor its CSR efforts in the entire organisation and to incorporate
a sustainability mindset in the everyday working life. A CSR organisation responsible for
CSR related initiatives, progress, communication, and reporting has therefore been set up.
Environmental commitments
•

AAK has been a member of UN Global Compact since January 2003 and has now
released its second Sustainability Report 2010/2011.

•

AAK is a member of the founding group of the RSPO, and in 2009 two of AAK’s
production plants obtained RSPO supply chain certification, seven in 2010, and today
all relevant plants are certified.

•

AAK has developed and manages the GreenPalm Book&Claim System, which is a
system for trade with RSPO certificates. The GreenPalm has been set up to promote
the production of sustainable palm oil by allowing the producers to sell GreenPalm
certificates and earn extra income for their sustainable crops. The GreenPalm
programme has approximately 400 members, ranging from growers to end-customers.
GreenPalm is further described on page 54.

•

AAK’s operations depend on heat and steam, which makes them relatively energyintensive. The company is therefore committed to continuously increase energy
efficiency by, among others, the use of new technology and where possible, increase
the use of renewable energy sources. In addition AAK continuously introduces
initiatives to be more environmentally friendly, which include improvement of their
waste management and use of environmentally friendly packaging. AAK’s ongoing
aim is to become more environmentally friendly tomorrow than it is today, and some
of the objectives and initiatives to reduce the environmental impact include:
•
•
•

•

•

•

•

52

The Danish plant aims to reduce water consumption by 10 percent.
The Swedish plant targets a 6 percent reduction in energy consumption.
The UK plant has set a goal to reduce steam consumption by 10 percent and
carbon emissions beyond national targets.
The Netherlands plant has installed a wastewater management process that
returns clean water directly to the local waterway.
The US plant in New Jersey has reduced energy consumption, effluent and waste
significantly and is currently installing new energy-efficient plants to reduce
energy costs per tonne of product produced even further.
The Mexican plant has made significant progress within energy reduction, waste
management and steam consumption through many small improvement projects.

AAK’s two main goals in 2011 to improve the impact on the environment were to
develop learning and best practice across the production plants; and secondly to
benchmark performance and develop local improvement programmes.

In 2003, AAK entered into a partnership with the UNDP to install simple
machinery (a simple diesel engine) in rural villages in Burkina Faso. The objective
was – and still is – to reduce the women’s daily workload and at the same time
increase their opportunities for generating an income. This project was a success
and has been expanded to a national project headed by the government and
comprising all of Burkina Faso. The government’s national goal is to implement a
multi functional platform in each village. AAK is stills a partner in the project.
AAK is one of the leading consumers of shea kernels that grow in some of the
world’s poorest countries in West Africa. AAK works directly with the women
who collect the shea kernels, building capacity in local communities. The work in
these areas includes the formation of women’s groups in the villages and teaching
the women how to maintain the quality of the kernels, and how to make the
shea supply chain as short, transparent and efficient as possible. In West Africa,
AAK works together with almost 10,000 women which gives them direct market
access to the industrial consumer of shea kernels, without binding them to trade
with AAK, and thereby obtain a higher price than if they sold to middlemen. On
23 March 2012 AAK and the government of Burkina Faso signed an agreement
engaging AAK in tripling the activities with the women groups with the support
of the government. Off season the women have the possibility of obtaining micro
loans from AAK instead of being forced to sell their future collection of kernels to
middlemen at low prices.
Since 2009, AAK Latin America has supported the non-profit organisation “Un
techo para mi País” (“A roof for my country”). The organisation works together
with the most marginalised populations, constructing transitional homes and
implementing social inclusion programmes to empower slum residents with the
tools to improve their quality of life. AAK and ten other companies took part in
the construction of transitional houses for 35 families in four irregular settlements
(poor urban neighbourhoods without access to basic services) in Montevideo.

AAK in Sweden: Supporting summer camps for Chernobyl children.
AAK in Mexico: Summer courses for children involving workshops like yoga,
jazz, aerobic, ballroom dancing, karate etc.
AAK in Denmark: Hosting an annual science cup within natural sciences,
supported by the Danish Ministry of Education and the Confederation of Danish
Industry.
AAK in UK: Participation in the event named “Our World” for Young Enterprise,
an education enterprise that helps young people learn about business.

During 2010, AAK implemented a Code of Conduct with 35 percent of its staff. Each
individual site and business area determined the best means of implementing the Code
depending on local legislation, culture and level of knowledge. By the end of 2011 the
Code was almost fully implemented.

The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil
To obtain The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification, the
palm oil producer must implement and document compliance with 8 principles
and 39 criteria stipulated by RSPO. This includes, among others:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

reduce deforestation
preserve biodiversity
respect the livelihoods of rural communities
ensure that no new or high conservation value forests are converted into palm oil plantations
respect the basic rights of workers and communities
implement health and safety measures for employees
respect the rights of indigenous people

Today, these criteria on sustainability are beyond doubt the worlds strictest for any agricultural crop.
For more information about the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm oil, visit www.rspo.org.

GreenPalm
A certificate trading programme for sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil.
It is possible to process and ship sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil separated from
non-sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil. However, as only approximately 12% of the
global palm oil and palm kernel oil is currently certified as sustainable palm oil by RSPO, the
physical segregation of sustainable oil adds cost at every stage.
The GreenPalm programme bypasses the physical supply chain completely as:
•

RSPO certified palm oil producers can register a quantity of their output with the GreenPalm
programme. They are awarded one GreenPalm certificate for each tonne of palm oil which has been
sustainably produced. They can then put those certificates up for sale on the GreenPalm web based
trading platform.

•

Manufacturers or retailers can then bid for and buy those certificates online, in order to be able to
claim that they have supported the production of sustainable palm oil. The payment is made directly
to the palm oil producer. The palm oil itself is sold, processed and purchased in the usual way.

•

By buying a product which bears the GreenPalm logo, consumers can make environmentally
responsible purchasing decisions and make a positive contribution to the production of certified
sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil.

By making or selling products which are covered by the GreenPalm programme food manufacturers and
retailers can reward palm oil producers for working in a sustainable and responsible way, and tell their
customers that they have done so.
More than 2,600,000 certificates have now been sold via the GreenPalm trading platform.
