Annual review



Social responsibility
Social matters
RIAS considers the protection of secure social relations an important element in the operation of a business. On a monthly basis, a follow-up on
absence due to sickness is carried out for the purpose of identifying signs of
poor job satisfaction; and on the whole RIAS is continually working towards
securing the best possible working environment. Likewise, the company
has a high awareness as to the health of the employees which, concretely,
has led to the company’s contribution towards a health-insurance scheme.
Environmental matters
RIAS consciously puts in an effort to limit the environmental impact of the
application of the company’s products. This takes place via the membership of the organisation Wuppi. The objective of Wuppi is that of collecting
and disposing of PVC waste in a sustainable manner. Moreover, RIAS is
focused on the company’s CO2 consumption. A project has been initiated
for the purpose of minimising the energy consumption through the implementation of various energy-conserving measures, in the production as in
the administration.
Human rights
RIAS typically enters into long-term supplier relations. Other than financial
and quality evaluations, the overall evaluation of the individual supplier
will also contain an evaluation as to whether the supplier exercises conventional social responsibility, comprising the elimination of child labour etc.
Combat-of-corruption initiative
RIAS has implemented a ”whistle blower” hotline facilitating an opportunity for our employees to inform impartial persons of the ThyssenKrupp Group about any infringement of the corruption or cartel-formation practices, or the suspicion thereof.
