STATUTORY STATEMENT ON SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITYStatutory statement on social responsibility, cf section 99a of the Danish Financial Statements Act.As the Company has entered into a management and administrationagreement with the management companyand therefore has no staff besides the CEO, the Companyhas not prepared any social guidelines with regard tostaff.SPEAS’s main object is to make investment commitmentsto private equity funds, and the private equity funds’policies regarding responsible investment are included asan integral part of the investment process. SPEAS believesthere is a positive connection between a company’s longtermsuccess and its compliance with as well as ongoingadaptation to ethical and environmental market norms.In cooperation with the management company, SPEASassesses (i) whether the private equity company hasadopted a code of practice regarding responsible investment,(ii) to which extent the private equity companyconsiders other relevant ethical and environmental issuesprior to making an investment, (iii) how relevant ethicaland environmental issues are addressed by the portfoliocompanies during the holding period, and (iv) theongoing reporting to the investors regarding status anddevelopment of same.Thus, SPEAS has only indirect influence on the individualprivate equity funds’ choice of companies in which toinvest, however, the Company’s basic premise is thatcompanies comply with laws and rules determined by nationalauthorities on the markets in which the companyoperates as well as with internationally adopted normsconcerning human rights and labour standards.If the private equity company has not adopted any recognisedcode of practice regarding responsible investmentor implemented a satisfactory policy in this regard, SPEASand the management company will, to the extent deemedappropriate, enter into a dialogue with the private equitycompany with a view to including relevant ethical andenvironmental issues in the investment process.
