Corporate social
responsibility (Csr)
We support the UN Global
Compact’s ten principles
but have taken a step
forward by including
animal welfare

In December 2009, NeuroSearch decided to join the UN
Global Compact network and thereby agree to observe
the ten principles defined by the UN.

I hope you will be inspired by our CSR strategy, which
contains clear policies and innovative activities
implemented by NeuroSearch staff in 2010.

For NeuroSearch staff and management, joining the
network reflected a decision to systematise and document
our corporate social responsibility values and activities.
In some cases, it meant that we had to define our policies
and, in others, that we had to describe what we had always
done. What is most important to all of us at NeuroSearch
is that we, as an organisation, are socially responsible in
all respects.

I look forward to many exciting CSR initiatives the future.

Patrik Dahlen
CEO

For this reason, we are very pleased to support the Global
Compact and all the CSR initiatives we have embarked
upon since 2009. Through our core business and our CSR
strategy, we wish to motivate our employees and attract
new colleagues. We want to make a positive impression
on the world around us through more dialogue and by
creating innovation through the strategic alliances with
our collaboration partners and stakeholders.
We support the ten principles of the UN Global Compact,
but NeuroSearch has an additional step and is assigning
a very high priority to animal welfare, which plays an
important role in our core business.

Social Responsibility report which is available in its
