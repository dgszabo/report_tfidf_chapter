Environmental report of management

The company’s environmental work in 2009/10
focused on supply chains and products.

2. Reduction of the need for transport via
more efficient warehousing structure.

In contrast to earlier years, the report is not concerned with the environmental impacts of the production in Aalborg, as this has been outsourced
from the Aalborg factory.

3. Customers will gain increased possibilities
for selection of forms of transport with low
energy consumption.
Logistics were optimised and raw materials
in the supply chain are now transported to a
higher extent as sea freight, which is the best
solution for the environment.

The report contains a description of the implementation of the environmental action programme for
2009/10 and the follow-up on environmental goals.

IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS, AALBORG:
•

Analysis of upholstery solutions with better recycling possibilities:
The analysis shows that polyester fabrics
should be laminated with polyester foam, as
other types of foam make recycling difficult.
Upholstery solutions which consist of different materials can be pulverised mechanically
and, for example, reused in Gabriel’s “Silent
Solution” screens.

•

Product development in accordance with
the environmental concept Cradle to Cradle:
The development project has been successfully implemented, and Gabriel can now supply selected colours and designs from the
existing product range with C2C certification.

•

Dismantling of technical installations with
focus on the minimisation of environmental impacts:
Installations have been dismantled, and a large
proportion of materials has been passed on for
reuse, partly as spare parts at the dye works
ScanDye, while the waste has been sorted at
source for recycling. Dismantling caused no accidents and had no impact on the environment.

•

Gabriel’s warehouse was moved to Lithuania
next to the dye works ScanDye, which minimises transport needs between warehouse
and production.

The improvement project covers three
initiatives:
1. Increased use of sea freight rather than air
freight from the Far East.

Gabriel has formalised the management of
all transport in the new organisational unit
“TransportMaster”, which optimises all transport. This work includes the reviewing of contracts with customers on the form of delivery.
•

Expansion of the product range to include
more environmentally- and health-labelled
designs:
Gabriel’s range of woollen furniture fabrics
which has been labelled with the Flower environmental label for several years has now
also been labelled with the Oeko-Tex health
label. This label makes it easier for customers to choose environmentally sound solutions Oeko-Tex is a widely used health label
and further supports Gabriel’s philosophy of
supplying products which meet documented
quality and environmental requirements.

MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENT GOALS IN AALBORG:
•

Reduction of consumption of heating by at
least 20% from 35,207 m3 in 2008/09 to
28,562 m3:
The heating consumption was 35,587 m3. The
goal was not reached because more tenants
than expected moved into Gabriel Business
Park during the year.

Environmental Report 2009/10 |

8

Environmental report of management - continued

Consumption was also negatively affected by
a very long and cold winter, which increased
the need for heating.
•

Reduction of electricity consumption
equivalent to 100,000 kWh. The basis
is last year’s consumption of approximately 660,000 kWh excluding production:
Energy consumption was 405,800 kWh and
the goal was thus reached inter alia by using
energy-saving IT equipment.

•

Reduction of paper consumption by 20%
from approx. 7,000 kg to 5,600 kg:
Consumption was 2,235 kg and the goal was
thus reached. The reduction was achieved
mainly by discontinuing a number of standard
printouts of computerised lists and instead
extracting data which the user can see on the
screen.

Farveriet Scandye
Litauen

At the end of the financial year, Gabriel’s employees
made up 55% of the total number of users of the
property. The consumption of electricity, heating
and water concerning Gabriel’s activities is therefore considerably lower than the figures stated.
Determining principles and methods which can
relate these environmental impacts to the individual tenants is part of the environmental action
programme for 2010/11.

MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENT GOALS AT THE DYE WORKS
SCANDYE:
•

Reduction of current water consumption
by at least 7%, from 204 litres/kg to 190
litres/kg:
Water consumption was 171 litres/kg, and the
goal was thus reached.

•

Reduction of current gas consumption by
at least 9%, from 1.36 m3 natural gas/kg
to 1.24 m3/kg:
Consumption was 1.11 m3 natural gas/kg,
and the goal was thus reached.

Environmental Report 2009/10 |

Environmental report of management - continued

•

Reduction of current electricity consumption by at least 1%, from 1.77 kWh/kg to
1.75 kWh/kg:
Consumption was 1.58 kWh/kg, and the goal
was thus reached.

CRITERIA FOR DETERMINATION OF SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
Following Gabriel’s environmental policy, significant environmental impacts are determined on
the basis of the following criteria for direct and
indirect environmental impacts:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Energy consumption and energy production.
Quantities of waste water and their content
of substances with an environmental impact.
Chemicals and dyes.
The total quantity of waste.
Information in safety datasheets.
Statutory limit values.
Requirements under the EU Flower eco-label.
Requirements under the Oeko-Tex health label.
New information from institutes, authorities
and others with extensive expertise in the
area of the environment.

Gabriel has notified the City of Aalborg of the contamination and investigations have been started
to establish the extent of the contamination for
the purpose of removing it or taking other measures.
The environmental data are given on page 15.

ASSESSMENT OF INDIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
Indirect environmental impacts at subcontractors’ premises are determined on the basis of the
same criteria of significance which apply to Gabriel’s activities in Aalborg.
Environmental matters are evaluated in visits to
subcontractors, and Gabriel requires its suppliers
to comply with all local statutory requirements.
Subcontractors are also evaluated in relation to
Gabriel’s environmental requirements, and action
plans are reviewed with suppliers to ensure that
their environmental impacts are constantly being
reduced.

The importance of environmental impacts is expressed by setting up key figures which show the
impact relative to production.

The environmental audits made at selected subcontractors’ premises include mapping of environmental parameters and environmental management, and an assessment of compliance with
ISO 14001 requirements.

The goal is to minimise the relative environmental
impact.

The criteria for labelling with the EU Flower are
also used.

ASSESSMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AT THE
AALBORG SITE

Significant indirect environmental impacts at
subcontractors’ premises include:
• Energy consumption and waste water in
scouring and dyeing.
• Consumption of chemicals.
• Energy consumption.
• Raw materials.
• Waste from production.
• Waste water.
• Transport of raw materials and finished goods.

The requirements regarding noise specified by
the City of Aalborg were complied with. The terms
are given in notes on page 17.
Oil contamination at an old oil tank was found in
November when carrying out earthworks. The oil
tank was last used in 1998 when it was emptied
and cleaned.

Environmental Report 2009/10 |

10

Environmental report of management - continued

Consumption of raw materials is primarily wool
from New Zealand and polyester for production of
furniture fabrics.
The environmental qualities of Gabriel’s products
ensure that there is no impact on the environment
from either processing or many years of use by
the consumer.
The products can be handled after their useful
lives as ordinary non-hazardous waste or recycled, as they contain no hazardous substances
such as heavy metals.
Gabriel makes audits and other follow-ups on suppliers to identify the direct environmental impacts.
We have, for example, carried out a follow-up on
the dye works ScanDye, and Gabriel China carries out similar follow-ups on Chinese partners.

The working environment
Gabriel wants to provide a good working environment for all employees with emphasis on safety,
health and job satisfaction.
This wish and legislation on health and safety at
work form the basis for developing the working
environment.

Employee participation
Delegation of responsibility and a processoriented work procedure ensure the individual
employee an influence on his or her own work situation at Gabriel.
Employees are involved in environmental management under Gabriel’s environmental management system and they participate in the
handling of environmental aspects on the basis
of the individual’s area of responsibility.

Environmental Report 2009/10 |

Environmental approvals

Gabriel no longer needs special environmental
permits to emit waste water etc. because there is
no longer any production in Aalborg.

Environmental action
programme 2010/11

Manufacturing processes:
• An investigation of options for the reduction
of water consumption in the supply chains.
Gabriel Business Park:
• Development of and training in the use of contingency plans and communicating information to other owners in Gabriel Business Park.
•

Reduction of energy requirements for cooling
of server room.

•

Development of allocation keys for environmental impacts between the tenants in Gabriel
Business Park.

The environmental action programme includes
the following components:

MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENT GOALS
Measurable Improvement goals for Gabriel
Aalborg:
• Reduction of the current quantity of waste by
at least 20% from 22.0 tons to 17.6 tons.

At the end of the financial year, Gabriel’s
employees made up 55% of the total number
of users of the property. The consumption of
electricity, heating and water concerning Gabriel’s activities is therefore considerably lower than the figures stated in this report.

Measurable maintenance of existing goals and
improvement goals at the dye works ScanDye:
• Reduction of current water consumption by at
least 3.6%, from 171 litres/kg to 165 litres/kg.
•

Maintenance of current gas consumption at
the current level of 1.11 m3 natural gas/kg.

•

Reduction of current electricity consumption
by at least 1.9%, from 1.58 kWh/kg to 1.55
kWh/kg.

IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS
Products:
• Performing LCA on selected main products
based on the latest environmental data.
•

Expansion and marketing of product range
with C2C certified products.

•

Gaining C2C certification of a polyester product.

•

Preparing guidelines on how to use products
to extend their useful lives.

Determining principles and methods which
can relate these environmental impacts more
accurately to the individual tenants is therefore part of the environmental action programme for 2010/11.
•

Examining the possibilities of updating and reusing samples which have been sent out on
the market.

Responsibility for implementation of the various
activities in the environmental action programme
has been assigned, and the activities will be carried out by 30 September 2011.

Notes
HISTORICAL DATA

vide Lithuanian data in future reports.

Contrary to previous years, environmental data
are no longer affected by production in Aalborg.
These historical data were therefore not included
but they can be found in previous reports.

Emissions of NOx and CH4 (methane) were not
included as the quantity emitted is considered insignificant.

In May 2009, production was completely outsourced to the dye works ScanDye, which meant significant environmental indicators and impacts from
ScanDye. The relative environmental impacts in
particular are relevant in relation to Gabriel’s production because total consumption also includes
production for customers other than Gabriel.
Historical consumptions of the most important
raw materials have been provided for the last five
years as this consumption is not affected by the
place of production.

Consumption of district heating was primarily waste heat from production of electricity.
A varying part of the electricity consumption was
renewable energy from wind turbines and hydroelectric power.
The Danish Energy Agency’s standard factors of
17 January 2011 for calorific value and CO2 emissions were used concerning natural gas emissions.

WASTE WATER
KEY INDICATORS
Gabriel’s environmental data include key indicators (the figure A in accordance with EMAS III)
such as energy efficiency, material efficiency, water, waste and emissions, which express the total
annual input/impacts in the various areas.
The figure B which expresses total output, and
the figure R which expresses the ratio A/B, which
is also indicated under environmental data.

Waste water emissions equal the purchased quantity of public potable water.

CONSUMPTION OF RAW MATERIALS
The stated consumption of raw materials includes waste during production, which was approx.
5%. The consumption of raw materials includes
Gabriel’s total consumption.

WASTE
ENERGY
A cooling of 35 degrees C was used for conversion of m3 of district heating to KWh.
Calculation factors provided by Energicenter Aalborg were used for calculation of CO2 and SO2
emissions.
Because of uncertainty with respect to emissions
in Lithuania concerning electricity, Danish key figures were used. An attempt will be made to pro-

Waste recorded does not include construction
and metallic waste from renovation of buildings
and plant.

BENCHMARKING
It has not been possible at this time to obtain relevant benchmarking data.
