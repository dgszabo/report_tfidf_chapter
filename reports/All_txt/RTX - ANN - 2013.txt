CORPORATE SOCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY (CSR)
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
It is an integrated value in RTX to demonstrate responsible behavior towards
the stakeholders of the Group. This
value is reflected in both the preparation and implementation of strategic
targets and actions plans.
RTX has defined the following values
as a way of conduct both internally and
externally:
Proactive in the way we develop our
business and workplace for future challenges and possibilities.
Professional in the way we conduct
ourselves towards our customers, collaborators, employees and society.
Focus in the way we efficiently achieve
good results which create value for our
customers and other stakeholders.
Team Spirit in the way we work
together and utilize our common and
individual potentials in the company.
RTX is currently working on improving
and adjusting our policies within CSR,
and we will in the coming years increase focus on establishing procedures
and policies for the Group’s optional
work with social and environmental
responsibility. In addition, to comply
with Danish and international rules,
RTX will demonstrate its responsibility
(through monitoring and measuring)
which is an ingrained value in the Group
but has not yet been fully formalized
with policies.
We wish to contribute to a positive
development in our community, and
among other initiatives RTX has in the
financial year 2012/13 funded two students from Aalborg University’s ELITEprogram within Wireless Communication, who can now spend part of their
education in a recognized university in
the US.

RTX supports the fundamental principles of UN’s Global Compact on human
rights, employees’ rights, child labor,
environment and anticorruption. RTX
requires that its suppliers respect and
conform to the same principles.
WORKING ENVIRONMENT
At the end of the financial year
2012/13 the Group employed 154
employees, of which 99 are employed
in Denmark, 52 in Hong Kong, 3 in the
US. RTX strives to manage the company professionally in all respects. All
employees are offered facilities and
employee terms in line with the local conditions. RTX has for its Danish
premises obtained The Danish Working
Environment Service’s green smiley as a
symbol of compliance with the environmental regulations on a physical and
psychical good working environment.
RTX highly values a good working environment, and we annually perform an
employee satisfaction survey. The results are analyzed and reviewed by the
management with a subsequent summary presentation for the employees.
Regularly during the year we invite
all employees to internal information
meetings, where management encourages an open and constructive dialog.
A good working environment and a
high job satisfaction result in satisfied
employees, high efficiency, low staff
turnover and a low level of absence.
Therefore, RTX has in the new financial
year initiated investments in securing
a continued good indoor climate in the
premises in Noerresundby.
Management is currently working on
optimizing processes to ensure knowledge and cooperation. The development-processes have been ISO certified
since 2002.

RTX is constantly working on securing
the employees’ job satisfaction, and we
want to be an attractive employer for all
employees, irrespective of sex, religion
and ethnical background. RTX’s staff
policy is intended for attracting and
maintaining highly qualified and motivated employees. As regards employment and recruitment it is our intention to assure both male and female
candidates, despite the fact that the
company is operating in a male-dominated working environment.
RTX has for instance formulated policies
for senior and handicapped employees,
and some of our employees have been
comprised by these policies in the latest
years. RTX cooperates with the local job
centers in their schemes for work test
assessment and trainee periods for unemployed, and in some cases we have
employed these persons in RTX after a
training period.
In 2013 RTX introduced a whistleblower policy in order to emphasize to
our employees that RTX is an open and
trustworthy organization, and that we
encourage everyone to report serious
and sensitive matters concerning leak of
our business moral or valid legislation.
The Supervisory Board in RTX has in
2012/13 discussed and adopted a
policy intended to secure a relevant
diversity in the management levels. In
the financial year 2012/13 women have
not been represented in the Supervisory Board, and it has therefore been
decided that by 2017 at the latest,
the company must insure at least one
female member of the board members
elected at the General Annual Assembly.
In 2013 RTX became an associated
member of the Confederation of Danish

company like ours, and this ensures an
energy-saving setup. Furthermore, RTX
works with energy reducing setups by
changing to energy saving light sources.
RTX cooperates with a number of customers, who are working on developing
energy-saving radio technologies. Consequently, one of these development
projects is partly financed by Eurostars
(www.eurostars-eureka.eu). Further-

as RTX encourages its sub-suppliers
to use environmentally acceptable raw
materials and products. RTX requires
observation of directives settling the

electronic equipment (RoHS, REACH and
WEEE directives).
