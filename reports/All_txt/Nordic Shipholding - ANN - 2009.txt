Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)Nordic Tankers has a responsibility for contributing to a global,sustainable development – economically, socially andenvironmentally. One of Nordic Tankers’ three basic valuesis integrity, which emphasises the Company’s will and desireto be mindful of its social responsibility. The Company haslaunched a number of initiatives in this field, but has not yetformulated any strategy or policy for the area. In January2010, the Company supplemented its ownership of vesselswith its own operating organisation and is planning on acceleratingefforts to systematise already existing initiativesin the area and identifying any further initiatives that maybe launched. Later, these projects are expected to form thebasis of the formulation of a strategy and policy in the area.
