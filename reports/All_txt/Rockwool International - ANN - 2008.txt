Social Charter for the Rockwool Group
The products and services sold by the Rockwool Group
have a positive impact on the global problems of climate
change and diminishing reserves of fossil energy. At the
same time they improve the living conditions for millions
of people by giving them thermal comfort, affordable
heating and cooling, reduced fire risk, a lower noise and
vibration level, and fewer chemicals in vegetables from
greenhouses. These basic, positive contributions to the
world are important for the Group’s employees, for its
management and Board and for the spirit in which we all
work.
The fact that the Group offers a positive contribution
to the world is also paramount for the Group’s largest
shareholders, the Rockwool Foundation and the Kähler
Family members. According to its bylaws, the Rockwool
Foundation has to spend its entire earnings to the benefit
of society.

the shareholders a return on their capital. However, the
priorities should not only be set according to where the
Group can make most money; it should also be ensured
that the Group continues to have a positive impact on
society in the countries and on the continents where it
operates.
Therefore the Group should continue avoiding being
involved in products and in operations which have a
negative impact on people’s health and well-being, and
we shall conduct our business in a way that also ensures a
positive social impact on our surroundings. Conducting the
business according to high ethical standards, and training
personnel to a high international level, are typical ways
in which the Rockwool Group positively influences our
environment and society - wherever we operate.
The Group maintains an open dialogue with its
stakeholders.

Of course the Rockwool Group as a company has to
make money in order to develop the business and offer

Energy & environment
Better insulation is one of the most profitable CO2 abatement technologies. This is crucial,
especially in times of financial crisis when governments are preparing legislation which will
give cost-efficient green tech jobs while at the same time reducing their dependence on
expensive and vulnerable energy imports. The race for energy efficiency in buildings is now
being expanded to the most important area: the existing building stock.

Better buildings are essential
Buildings are key to tackling the challenges of climate
change, security of energy supply and energy costs, which
continue to place an unnecessary heavy burden on our
strained economy. Buildings account for some 40% of
energy and end-use CO2 emissions in the EU and the US.
But it does not need to be like this. Today it is possible to
make buildings that are so well-insulated, energy-efficient
and comfortable that by adding a solar panel (or other
means of renewable energy) it is feasible to have new
buildings that supply more energy to the grid than they
consume. Within our large, existing building stock we can
reduce the excessive waste of fossil fuel by up to 90%.
From hot air to real commitments
Among many good measures, insulation is one of the
most profitable CO2 abatement technologies. And this
is increasingly being noted by governments and opinion
leaders. Even in countries that are concerned whether they
can afford CO2 reduction commitments. Better insulation is
a measure that society cannot afford to ignore, the less so
in the present economic crisis.

approx. 25%. The recast directive, which is expected
to be finally approved in 2010, undertakes to tap the
largest potential for better insulation: the existing building
stock. Making buildings more energy efficient also has
very positive employment benefits. According to the EU
Commission a recast directive will enable 280-450,000
potential new jobs by 2020. For these obvious reasons,
the EU Commission no longer wants only buildings
larger than 1,000 square metres to be obliged to energy
efficient modernisation. It should cover all buildings. The
Commission will also require all member states to plan for
very low energy standards (e.g. passive house standards)
for both new and refurbished buildings. The first countries
will require passive house standards for new homes within
just four years, but no country has, so far, made a plan for
renovation to very low energy standards.

Who will be the first?
Examples of countries that will require standards for new homes

The EU (covering more than 60% of Rockwool insulation
sales) has confirmed its commitment to improve energy
efficiency by 20% by 2020. Better buildings are key to
achieving its goal of a 20% cut in CO2 emissions before
the end of the next decade. This target will be raised to
30% if an ambitious international climate agreement is
reached, hopefully at the UN climate summit (COP15) in
Copenhagen in December 2009. With the Green New
Deal ambitions of the new US administration this target
has become a challenging, but no longer impossible
mission.
More efficient requirements – more insulation
In November 2008, the EU Commission launched its
proposal for a strengthened Energy Performance of
Buildings Directive. The existing directive from 2002
has already inspired many governments to improve
energy efficiency requirements for new buildings by

to be very low energy, passive house, zero energy / zero carbon, or
energy generating (also called plus energy house).

Under this heading, the Rockwool Group
is running a campaign to focus on the
heat loss from buildings as important
climate and economic issues. Using

waste from poorly insulated buildings
suddenly becomes visible.

End-use efficiency
The EU Energy End-Use Efficiency and Energy Services
Directive (2006/32/EC) will provide another energy
efficiency boost in the same magnitude as the 2002
version of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.
From 2008 and nine years ahead the member states
must enhance their efficiency on final energy by at least
9%. The member states must, for instance, require energy
providers to support their end-users in implementing
energy efficiency improvements. A number of countries are
allocating funds for refurbishment programmes. Germany
has earmarked EUR 2.4 billion per year to improve the
energy efficiency of the housing stock from before the last
oil crisis. France will retrofit 400,000 old dwellings per
year – and all public buildings must have been renovated
by 2012. The Netherlands will improve energy efficiency
by at least 30% in 200-300,000 buildings per year. The
UK will double saving targets and increase subsidies from
2009–2011. Also countries like Spain and Belgium have
ambitious renovation programmes.
Upfront financing
It is essential that financing of energy efficiency measures
will be available. The credit crunch is pushing the EU and
many governments to improve financing schemes. In
November 2008, the European Commission launched a
European Economic Recovery Plan, aiming at EUR 200
billion (1.5% of GDP) in “smart investments”. One of the
steps is better energy efficiency in buildings. Based on
these first recommendations, the European Union needs to
adopt an ambitious plan for buildings. One of the actions is
the EU structural funds that will be further directed towards
improving the energy efficiency in buildings.

Energy efficiency outside the EU
In Russia, a presidential decree sets the goal that the
energy consumption in Russia should be reduced by 40%
in 2020 compared to 2007 measured at constant GDP
level. By 2009, federal laws on economic stimulations
and mechanisms will be in place. Local initiatives are also
gradually picking up speed. Moscow City has put up a very
ambitious goal to save 40% in energy consumption for
heating in buildings in the coming three years.
In Canada and the US many efforts are made at local and
regional level. In the Ontario province, where the Rockwool
Group will inaugurate an additional production line in Q1
2009, insulation requirements for new homes have been
tightened by 28% - with further improvements announced
for 2011.
In the US, a USD 2,000 tax credit is given nationwide
to home owners who insulate properly. In February,
the administration of President Obama launched more
ambitious energy savings initiatives in its stimulus plan.
It includes more than USD 15 billion for energy efficiency
related grants, improvement of federal buildings and
programmes to cut energy bills for low-income families.
Keeping our house in order
The Rockwool Group has decided to impose stricter lowenergy requirements for the construction and renovation of
our own buildings. The Group is continuously improving our
energy efficiency and thereby reducing the CO2 emissions
that are generated from our production. It was not
necessary to buy additional CO2 allowances in 2008. The
Group does not expect a need to buy additional allowances
in 2009.

In its lifetime, a typical Rockwool
product can save more than 100 times
the energy and CO2 emissions used for
its production, transport and disposal.
In its lifetime, more than 200 million
tonnes of CO2 will be saved by the use
of Rockwool insulation produced and
installed in 2008.
Rockwool insulation is used in building
Sweden’s most energy-efficient house,
’Villa Åkarp’. When finalized, the house
will generate 1.5 times as much energy
as it uses.

Save energy costs and CO2 – renovate your building.
A poorly insulated German 150 m2 one-family house from 1970 – with or without energy refurbishment
A household example
For the home owner, insulation is not
only one of the most effective ways
to save CO2. It demands no change of
daily routines, but actually increases the
quality of life. According to Deutsche
Energie-Agentur you can save 11 tonnes
of CO2 per year if you renovate a very
poorly insulated 150 m2 house from 1970
to German low-energy standards (60
kWh/ m2/year for heating) by installing
better insulation, good windows and
other energy efficiency measures. The
saved 3,600 litres of oil for heating
would, at German prices 18 February
2009, correspond to more than EUR
1,700 per year. If the house owner was
to save the same amount of CO2 by
using a bike instead of the car, he would
need to pedal some 70,000 km per year
– or 1.5 times around the globe. Luckily,
not all buildings are from 1970. But even
an average EU building could each year
save nearly 5 tonnes of CO2.

In order to make our environmental efforts more
transparent to our stakeholders, the Group has decided
to report from 2009 onwards how we manage our own
carbon emissions via the Carbon Disclosure Project.
Environmental investments will amount to EUR 25-30
million for 2009.
The Rockwool Group prioritises developing a continuous,
open and constructive dialogue with the local communities
that live and work in the areas in which we have factories.
The Group is currently involved in environmental litigation
in Croatia. Environmental law suits are exceptional for the
Rockwool Group.
