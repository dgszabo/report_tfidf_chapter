considered it an entirely natural part of its business basis to support the local area’s
development. Via the management’s implementation of and position on the recommendations on good corporate governance, the bank is also focused on those matters which
govern the interaction with the bank’s primary stakeholders, namely its shareholders
and customers, its management and employees, and the local areas in which the bank’s
branches are situated. The bank’s policy in the area of social responsibility is based on a
desire to run a responsible and value-creating bank which works consciously to create
the best results for shareholders, customers, employees, the local community and the
surrounding	environment	and	the	bank	as	a	financial	institution.	The	bank’s	policy	in	the

Some of the bank’s activities in 2012 for its main stakeholders are described below.

Customers
During the year, the bank continued its work on development of its advisory service for
customers. This includes:
•	 Further	development	of	the	bank’s	concept	within	the	area	of	advice	on	pensions,	
where the bank’s advisers give the customer a general view of pension saving
schemes and cover in the event of invalidity and death. The bank has a concept
which, in a simple and clear way, gives the customer a sound understanding in a
highly complex area, and where the customer is then in a position to make some
decisions	which	are	especially	critical	for	his	or	her	financial	situation.	On	the	basis	of	
this concept, the bank is systematically proceeding to contact those customers who
could have a need for advice in this area.
•	 Implementation	of	the	concept	of	all-inclusive	advice	where,	in	cooperation	with	
the	customer,	the	bank	prepares	a	review	of	the	customer’s	total	financial	situation,	
including loans, insurances, pension etc.
•	 Development	of	means	of	communication	between	the	bank	and	its	customers,	including development of easily understandable elements on the bank’s website which
give the customer a solid insight into some of the bank’s products. The banks Mobile
Bank offer is also being extended to include iPad.
•	 The	strength	of	Private	Banking	advice,	where	the	bank’s	asset	advisers	provide	specialised	advice	to	customers	with	complex	financial	situations.
