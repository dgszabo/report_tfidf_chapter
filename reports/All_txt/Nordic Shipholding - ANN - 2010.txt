Corporate social
responsibility (CSR)
Nordic Tankers focus its CSR efforts in areas related to health & safety, environment & climate,
general welfare and training for its employees.

Introduction
During the past year of operation many
initiatives relating to CSR have taken
place, although not under the headline
of CSR. During 2011, CSR will be organised in a way that these initiatives are
managed in a more consistent manner,
so progress can be tracked and results
reported.
As a first step towards a more structured approach to CSR, the Company
will report the CSR initiatives that have
taken place, following the 10 principles of
the United Nations Global Compact. The
report includes our CSR policy, the activities that have taken place during 2010
and the results wherever possible. The
report also includes our plans for 2011.
Framework
At this stage, the Company will focus our
CSR initiatives on areas within our sphere
of control: Employees in Nordic Tankers, at sea and ashore, and assets either
owned and/or technically managed by
Nordic Tankers. We will also participate
actively in CSR initiatives across the industry, through participation and in the
CSR committee in The Danish Shipowners’ Association and by following guidelines and supporting initiatives in IMO.
To Nordic Tankers CSR is not about charity, but it is about assuming responsibility
and taking part in the fundamental and
universal challenges concerning environ-

26

ment and climate, business ethics, basic
human rights and labour standards. Thus
Nordic Tankers’ efforts will focus on supporting and taking initiatives in areas that
support long-term sustainable growth
globally, nationally and in the company.

Nordic Tankers owned vessels are built
at shipyards with high standards, thus
nb_`[lg[dilcnsi`nb_p_mm_fmg[h[a_^
by Nordic Tankers Marine have a high
safety and welfare standard compared
to the industry average at such.

Overall CSR policy
Nordic Tankers have formulated the following overall CSR policy:

Nordic Tankers Marine continuously
strives to improve the safety and welfare on board our vessels. The aim is
to avoid accidents, harming people, the
environment or assets, and to ensure a
high retention rate among our seafarers.

In Nordic Tankers, we will actively initiate and participate in activities related
to CSR, and we will incorporate CSR
initiatives in our strategy at any given
time. We will focus its efforts on areas
related to health & safety, environment
& climate and general welfare and training. Nordic Tankers will strive to continuously improve itself in these fields and
communicate openly with stakeholders
about results. As with everything else in
Nordic Tankers, CSR challenges will be
met with a can-do attitude, and will be
solved with integrity and passion.

Human & Labour rights
With respect to human and labour rights,
Nordic Tankers has two main focus areas: safety and welfare, both at sea and
ashore.
A young fleet with modern accommodation and safety features
Nordic Tankers operates a modern fleet
with an average age of only 5,9 years.

To follow-up on the safety on the vessels
a number of KPI’s have been established
and thoroughly monitored on a monthly
basis. These KPI’s include among others:
Lost Time Incidents (the so called LTIs)
and Near Misses. Lost Time Incidents
are work related incidents resulting in
absence from work on a scheduled work
mbc`nihnb_^[s`iffiqchanb_chdols(
The LTI frequency is an international
standard calculated by multiplying the
number of LTI’s with a factor between
1.000.000 (one million) hours and the
actual number of working hours on
board our vessels and is calculated 12
months backwards. The goal setting for
the fleet for 2010 was 1,20 with an actual 2010 result of 1,80 equal to a total
of 8 LTI’s onboard 37 vessels in 2010.
None of these LTI’s resulted in the death
of any seafarer, but any incident to any
seafarer is one too many. All incidents
are thoroughly investigated and correc-

tive measures set in motion whenever
possible.
Near Misses are important to identify
and report, as it enables the company
to prevent accidents and incidents from
occurring. We have a goal for each vessel
to report minimum 4 Near Misses per
month. The result was 3,24 reports per
vessel per month which is at an acceptable level. Statistically we have seen that
the vessel with most Near Miss reports
over the past two years actually has not
had any accident or incidents for two
years in a row.
Seafarers or anybody else may report
any non-compliance with rules and policies regarding safety, environment, and
welfare through Nordic Tankers open reporting system accessible on the Nordic
Tankers web-site.
Correct procedures are one thing,
culture is another
Nordic Tankers Marine has all the safety
procedures and all the KPIs needed to
manage its vessels safely. But procedures are one thing, and culture is another. Although safety is a natural part of
a seafarer culture, we believe that it is an
area where we should never reach a level
of complacency, an area that can constantly be improved. During 2011, Nordic
Tankers will develop a plan that brings
safety to the “top of mind” of all Nordic
Tankers people, at sea and on shore.

participate in the Piracy committee in
The Danish Ship Owner’s Association,
which we find to be the correct way to
assert our influence and put pressure
on governments to co-operate and do
something against this serious threat to
the safety of seafarers and global trade.
Nordic Tankers operated vessels only
pass through this area by military escort in the EU Group Transit System (EU
GTS). Seafarers can ask to disembark
a vessel if it is scheduled to transit the
affected areas. Procedures for passing
through the areas are constantly updated
and are strictly adhered to. Procedures
include guidelines on speed, maneuverability, communication, the compulsory
installation of razor blade barbed wire
and much more. The vessels will be in
close contact with the Company Security Officer (CSO) before and during the
transit.
The threat situation is assessed on an
ihaicha\[mcm&[h^jli]_^ol_m[^domn_^
accordingly.
Being a seafarer in Nordic Tankers
Seafarers on Nordic Tankers vessels are
all employed in accordance with ILO
standards outlined in our Safety Management System. The new Maritime
Labour Convention of 2006 is about to
be implemented in Nordic Tankers and
shall be fully implemented during 2011.

All company seafarers are meeting the
standards outlined in STCW 95 (Standard
Training, Certification and Watch keeping) for training and certification. In addition to our existing training programs
a Competence Management System will
be implemented during 2011 to enable
our seafarers to drive our performance
to an even higher level.
Transparency in operation and good
communication between sea and shore
is vital to our operations and the welfare
of the seafarers and their families. The
vessels technically managed by Nordic
Tankers Marine have all the infrastructure necessary as vessels had satellite
equipment installed on board during
2009 and 2010, meaning that all seafarers now have internet and e-mail access.
Being in touch with your loved ones on a
regular basis is an important part of the
welfare at sea.
Seafarers receive monthly reports and
a regular newsletter: SEALINK with information specifically targeted for the
life on board.
Nordic Tankers Marine aims to have the
best employees. One of the contributing
factors to reach the ambitions is to be
able to attract and retain the right talent.
In 2010 the retention ashore at Nordic
Tankers Marine was 100% and at sea
90% - a satisfactory retention which is
high compared with the industry.

A safe and healthy culture ashore
During December 2010 Nordic Tankers
did a workplace assessment at the office in Copenhagen, where employees
were asked to answer a large number
of questions relating to their physical
and mental wellbeing at the workplace.
The main conclusion from the workplace
assessment was that Nordic Tankers
have generally satisfied, and highly motivated employees, with a high degree
of co-operation between employees, dej[lng_hnm[h^nb_clg[h[a_lm(Nb_;JP
also indicated areas for improvement.
An action plan to improve in these areas
has been made and will be implemented
during 2011.
Nordic Tankers has a range of offers to
enable employees to stay healthy and
enhance their physical wellbeing. All
employees are covered by health insurance, and other offers at the main office
in Copenhagen include:

Whereas safety at sea is a natural part of
seafarer culture, this is not necessarily
the case to the same extend ashore. As
mentioned above, Nordic Tankers will
develop a plan that brings safety to the
“top of mind” of all Nordic Tankers people, at sea and on shore.

Environment and Climate
Nordic Tankers wishes to focus its environmental efforts on a reduction of
CO2 and SOx emissions at sea, and a
reduction of power usage and travelling
ashore.
Ship efficiency matters for both
the environment and the bottom
line
The shipping industry is responsible for
close to 80% of the global transportation of goods and for approximately
3% of the world’s total CO2 emissions.
Compared to other means of transportation, shipping is by far the most energy
efficient. Nordic Tankers still wishes to
continually reduce its emissions. As fuel
costs account for a significant amount of
a vessel’s voyage costs, there is also a
financial incentive in reducing the consumption of fuel.
Within 2011 Nordic Tankers will implement a Ship Efficiency Energy Management Plan (SEEMP). The plan will
include programs for voyage optimisation, propulsion resistance management,
machine optimisation and instructions on
cargo handling optimization and energy
conservation awareness.
All vessels in Nordic Tankers slow steam,
if the schedule allows for slow steaming,
which is the case on approximately 75%
of all voyages. Slow steaming means that
a vessels sails at less than maximum
speed, reducing both fuel costs and CO2
emissions. Nordic Tankers also complies
with international guidelines of burning
low sulphur fuel oil. Areas requiring the

use of low sulphur fuel oil are increasing, reducing the overall SOx emissions.
Nordic Tankers have not calculated the
total CO2 emission of its fleet, but will
put this into practice during 2011.
A detailed plan for ISO 14001 certification of technical organization of Nordic
Tankers has been developed during 2010,
and it is expected to complete the certification by the end of 2011. ISO 14001
is a framework for a holistic strategic
approach to the organisation’s environmental policy and planning. For higher
impact reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions on our own vessels, we believe
that this is a global challenge that needs
to be dealt with at a global level. Nordic
Tankers supports, participates and ratifies all such initiatives through the Danish
Shipowner’s Assocation and IMO.
IT contributes too
During 2010 all the IT infrastructure
of Nordic Tankers was outsourced to a
datacenter and in this process all servers and back-up was virtualized. Our
partner focuses on innovative technologies and green data solutions resulting
in considerable energy and space usage
reductions. So not only does it reduce the
electricity bill of Nordic Tankers, but it
also reduces CO2 emissions from the IT
used by Nordic Tankers, and the disposal
of physical servers and back-up media.
During 2011, we plan to implement a
new printer solution that will take advantage of newer green technologies
such as power saving features and the
use of fixed ink.
