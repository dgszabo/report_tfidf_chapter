EnvironmentRIAS continuously strives to limit the environmental impactsof its activities. However, the environmental impact causedby RIAS’ activities is, in itself, insignificant, as RIAS’ activitiescomprise distribution and sales, but not production, ofplastic semi-manufactures.The Company is not a party to any environmental cases.
