Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility

Corporate social responsibilitySydbank has not formulated a formal CSR policy. All the sameSydbank is an enterprise operating as a responsible player insociety while respecting its business goals.The Bank is an active player in the activities of associations andsports. Numerous sponsorships are nurtured locally andregionally – not least amateur associations. In additionSydbank’s funds give small and large donations for cultural andsocial purposes.The local and regional commitment is the cornerstone ofSydbank’s corporate mission and one of the reasons why theBank remains the business partner characterised by closenessand local knowledge – despite its nationwide presence.Within the investment area Sydbank’s social responsibility isprimarily exercised via the manner in which investments aremade in the portfolios managed by the Bank. The Bank finds itthat the companies invested in comply with the UN
Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI).Also in relation to its employees the Bank takes its socialresponsibility seriously. Continuous initiatives within stress prevention,senior policy schemes and health promotion constitutesome of the reasons why Sydbank is a highly attractive workplace.Also in terms of environmental awareness, the Grouphas launched a range of initiatives in recent years aimed atminimising the Bank’s energy consumption.The Bank’s activities and CSR efforts aim to emphasiseSydbank’s position as ethically sound – among employees, clientsand other stakeholders.The Bank does not carry out targeted follow-up activities onthe effect of the efforts within this area.
