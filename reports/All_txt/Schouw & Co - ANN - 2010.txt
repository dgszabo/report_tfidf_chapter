CODE OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Statutory report on corporate
social responsibility
This statutory report on corporate social
responsibility (CSR) covers the reporting
period from January 1 – December 31,
2010 and forms part of the 2010 Annual
Report.
Schouw & Co. requires that all of the
Group’s companies comply with legislation and regulations applying in the
countries and local communities in which
they operate. However, no policies have
been adopted for voluntary incorporation
of corporate social responsibility into the
companies’ strategies and activities.

Schouw & Co. generally respects the
ten principles on human rights, labour
standards, the environment and anticorruption as expressed in the UN Global
Compact. The full wording of the ten
principles is provided on Schouw & Co.’s
website, www.schouw.dk.
It is important to Schouw & Co. that
the Group’s businesses endeavour to comply with the principles of human rights,
labour standards, the environment and
anti-corruption and that they seek assurance on reasonable standards when appointing business partners and suppliers.
The principles on the environment
may require that a balance is struck between cost and effect, but generally the
Group believes that it maintains high
standards when it comes to ensuring
reasonable environmental issues and
limiting environmental risks. In addition,
the Group addresses environmental conditions from a business criteria aspect
with due consideration for the long-term
perspectives and the Group’s good reputation.
