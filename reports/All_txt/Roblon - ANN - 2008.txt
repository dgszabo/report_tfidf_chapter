Environment
The external environmental impact from Roblon Engineering
is very limited and can be attributed primarily to energy consumption for illumination, heating and the painting process.
Roblon Industrial Fiber is environmentally certiﬁed to ISO
14001. Industrial Fiber has no emissions from processes that
have an impact on the external aquatic environment. Emissions to air are limited and are subject to ongoing control.
Roblon Lighting’s environmental impact is caused primarily by heating and lighting. Energy is also used to control
light sources. There are limited emissions to air in connection with the process of gluing ﬁbre bundles.
