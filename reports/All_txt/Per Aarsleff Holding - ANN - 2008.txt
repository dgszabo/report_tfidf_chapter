Health and safety, quality and the external environment

It is our policy to carry out all operations in a reliable way
with respect to safety and health and to avoid accidents by
prevention.

The goal to achieve a reduction in the number of accidents
in 2008 was not met. Nor was the goal to be below par
with the business.


With the view to meeting the gold in 2009, the work
preparing a common occupational health and safety
management system for Per Aarsleff A/S is intensified.
During 2007/2008, the focus on health and safety at work
has been strengthened, and we have worked intensely with
improvements on many fronts, among them the solving
of occupational health and safety assignments, strategic considerations, initiation off cross-organizational initiatives,
strengthening of the work in the safety organization, and the scope and contents of the occupational health and safety management system has almost been defined.

Thus we are making a targeted effort to obtain an occupational health and safety certificate for Per Aarsleff A/S, and we have chosen to emphasize the importance of involving everyone in the process to ensure that the desired improvements are obtained. We expect that the certificate will be obtained during 2009.
Concurrently with the occupational health and safety certificate work in the parent company, the management systems for occupational health and safety, quality and the environment are continuously developed in the parent company as well as the subsidiaries Wicotec A/S. Petri & Haugsted A/S, Dan Jord A/S, Centrum Paele A/S and Broderne Hedegaard A/S.
