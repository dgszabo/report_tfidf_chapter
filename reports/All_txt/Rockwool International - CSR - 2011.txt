Overview and introduction
The Rockwool Group has always been managed on the basis of values requiring
trustworthy and decent behaviour of the Rockwool Group and its employees. Since an
update in 2010 in connection with the introduction of the new corporate strategy, Rock
The Globe, the values of honesty, entrepreneurship, efficiency, passion and responsibility
have been basic for actions taken in the Group and transactions with our stakeholders
including suppliers and customers.
These values – as interpreted by the Rockwool Group - are further described on the
corporate website.
Conducting our business according to the corporate values is the adequate framework for
the Rockwool Group to conform with modern standards for responsible and reliable
business conduct as well as corporate social responsibility.
The Rockwool Group has a number of Policies and Manuals to secure conformity. All
employees must conform to the conditions covering their employment in the Rockwool
Group – including values and group policies.

On an overall level, The Rockwool Group has for many years expressed its commitment to
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the Group policy on social responsibility and the
Group’s social charter.
All employees and managers are required to ensure that these principles are being
followed.
The Group’s Principles of Leadership and procedures for bilateral conversations between
all managers and subordinates as well as regular, general evaluations of each employee
form the framework which helps ensuring that any misconduct according to these
principles are addressed and that corrective action is taken.

Special development 2011
In accordance with the Danish law on Annual Accounts, art. 99 a., the company must
annually report on its progress within the area on CSR. In addition to The Rockwool
Group’s general CSR policies and measures, this report covers - in each relevant section the special development and initiatives for the year 2011.
Updated reporting on Corporate Governance
In order to ensure an optimal communication of the Rockwool Group’s principles and
actions regarding corporate governance, the Group has updated the structure of the
annual report on Corporate Governance. The Group’s policy on Corporate Governance
itself has not been changed.

4

New supplier evaluation process
During 2011, the Rockwool Group’s sourcing and procurement department has introduced
a supplier evaluation process. This process will further strengthen the Group’s control with
suppliers of key raw materials – especially with focus on ISO and environmental
certifications as well as compliance with the Group’s code of conduct for suppliers.
Increased number of suppliers under corporate contracts
The share of suppliers who are under contract with the Rockwool Group’s corporate
procurement function have increased over the year. When under contract with the Group
procurement function, any supplier must comply to a set of standardised, international
requirements regarding for example environmental and quality certifications including also
the Rockwool Group’s Code of Conduct for Suppliers which has been made a part of the
standard contract template.
Also in the Group’s affiliated companies implementation of the Code of Conduct for
Suppliers continues.

Social Charter for the Rockwool Group
In addition, the Group has chosen to further describe its social commitment in the Social
Charter for the Rockwool Group.
The products and services sold by the Rockwool Group have a positive impact on the
global problems of climate change and diminishing reserves of fossil energy. At the same
time they improve the living conditions for millions of people by giving them thermal

5

comfort, affordable heating and cooling, reduced fire risk, a lower noise and vibration level,
and fewer chemicals in vegetables from greenhouses. These basic, positive contributions
to the world are important for the Group’s employees, for its management and Board and
for the spirit in which we all work.
The fact that the Group offers a positive contribution to the world is also paramount for the
Group’s largest shareholders, the Rockwool Foundation and the Kähler family members.
According to its bylaws, the Rockwool Foundation has to spend its entire earnings to the
benefit of society.
Of course the Rockwool Group as a company has to make money in order to develop the
business and offer the shareholders a return on their capital. However, the priorities should
not only be set according to where the Group can make most money; it should also be
ensured that the Group continues to have a positive impact on society in the countries and
on the continents where it operates.
Therefore the Group should continue avoiding being involved in products and in operations
which have a negative impact on people’s health and well-being, and we shall conduct our
business in a way that also ensures a positive social impact on our surroundings.
Conducting the business according to high ethical standards, and training personnel to a
high international level, are typical ways in which the Rockwool Group positively influences
our environment and society - wherever we operate.

General evaluation and expectations for the future

the most acknowledged principles for CSR have been applied in connection with the value
based management of our business. Moreover we are confident that the knowledge of the

guidance in all work done in the Rockwool Group. This is also reflected in our
communication with suppliers, customers and other stakeholders.
In the following the Rockwool Group will elaborate on the translation of its Policies into
actions taken with regards to ten of the most widely acknowledged principles of sound
corporate social responsibility.
Relevant policies and sources are listed in connection with each principle. The detailed

Environment
7. The company should support a precautionary approach to environmental
challenges.
Actions, systems and procedures
Due to the Rockwool Group’s corporate mission and the nature of the company’s
main product area, building insulation, the company is a major contributor to energy
efficiency and thereby reduction of CO2 emission, thus having a significant positive
influence on the environment by providing sustainable solutions addressing the
many challenges of global climate change. Also the company’s other products
provide major positive environmental advantages such as e.g. noise reduction and
improved indoor climate.
The Rockwool Group has signed the ICC (International Chamber of Commerce)
Business Charter for Sustainable Development. Rockwool has thereby committed
itself to improve environmental performance in accordance with the Charter’s
principles, to have in place management practices to effect such improvement, to
measure progress and to report this progress as appropriate, internally and
externally.
The Rockwool Group has also drawn up a Group Environment Policy. It is Group
policy to either meet or exceed all relevant national and international environmental
standards and legislation.
The Group’s Environment Management System includes safety management and
auditing.
A number of detailed manuals including detailed standards, procedures, audit and
reporting requirements have been established for all relevant production processes.
A number of the Rockwool Group’s production sites are certified according to the
ISO 14001 standard for environmental management.
Rockwool companies have won numerous environmental awards.
Major relevant product groups are subject to evaluation of their environmental
impacts based on a lifecycle assessment (LCA). LCA is a structured study of a
product’s positive and negative environmental impacts throughout its lifecycle: From
extraction and production of resources and raw materials through production to use
and final disposal of the product.
The Rockwool Group’s climate and environmental performance is published
annually in The Climate and Environmental Report. The report covers areas like
consumption of energy, raw material, water as well as data on emissions, waste etc.

Evaluation and expectations for the future
The Rockwool Group considers its performance in this area satisfactory and will
maintain this position.
The Group is currently not involved in environmental litigation other than in a case
with the authorities in Croatia. Environmental law suits are exceptional for the
Rockwool Group.

15

8. The Company should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental
responsibility.
Actions, systems and procedures
Besides the comprehensive existing system for managing and auditing
environmental impacts, The Rockwool Group is constantly developing
improvements of existing systems or new, relevant systems, programmes or
schemes which can help improve the company’s environmental performance or
promote a greater environmental responsibility.
Both the ICC Business Charter for Sustainable Development, the Rockwool Group’s
own environmental policy as well as its social charter promote our commitment to
constantly seeking ways to improve environmental performance.
The Group is a part of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), publicly reporting
according to strict procedures and standards about the company’s CO2 emission.
The CDP reporting allows the company to benchmark itself against other relevant
players.
The Rockwool Group has defined a general guideline for environmental
assessment of suppliers (under contract with the Group Procurement function). This
is used to screen existing and potential suppliers in order to assure that also their
environmental performance are taken into consideration when evaluating the
business relationship. This is seen as a tool to extend The Group’s commitment to
improve environmental performance also outside the company itself.
All suppliers under contract with the Group Procurement function are asked to sign
a declaration to the Code of Conduct for Suppliers for the Rockwool Group
including a commitment to comply with any relevant environmental legislation and in
general to act responsibly towards the environment.
All significant suppliers and contractors under contract with the Group Procurement
function are subject to random checks on environmental performance.
A calculation from 2010 of the Rockwool Group’s carbon foot print (audited and
verified by PriceWaterhouseCoopers) shows that in total, 4,000 million tonnes of
CO2 – equal to 2009 emissions from India, Russia and Germany combined - is the
positive net carbon footprint from the Rockwool Group’s production of insulation in
2009. This is approximately 20 times the result of the former calculation which not
sufficiently took into consideration the energy savings that particularly technical
insulation provides.

9. The company should encourage the development and diffusion of
environmentally friendly technologies.
Actions, systems and procedures
Being the world’s second largest producer of insulation material which in its lifetime
saves more than 100 times the energy used for its manufacturing and transportation,
the Rockwool Group plays a significant role in developing and diffusion of
environmentally friendly technologies through our sales of insulating systems for
building, industrial and marine and offshore applications.
Given the very energy and capital intensive nature of the Rockwool production
process all production sites and related procedures are audited on efficiency and
environmental performance and global best-practise is deployed.
With regard to the company’s products, a significant amount of resources are
invested in research and development of new technologies that can improve the
energy efficiency in buildings all over the world. Apart from own efforts and
competences engaged in this, The Rockwool Group also works together with a
large number of external partners such as universities and other institutions
involved in research and development in this area.
The Group also plays an active role in informing and working together with
authorities, opinion leaders and political decision makers in order to promote the
best possible framework in terms of public building codes etc. which will motivate a
higher level of energy efficiency in buildings.

21

Appendix A
Group policy on business responsibility
All managers will conduct their business in such a way that customers, employees and the
general public will consider companies within the Rockwool Group as responsible and
reliable firms. In particular, they will ensure that they act within the laws and regulations
applicable to their business.

22

Appendix B
Group Policy on business ethics

Guided by the Rockwool Group values, we encourage our employees to build appropriate
relationships with our business partners. With regard to such matters, good judgment is
always required as it is difficult to list rules that can anticipate every possible situation
without being overly prescriptive and harmful to the professional relationship. However,
we must seek an appropriate balance between building and maintaining strong
relationships and ensuring that our professionalism is maintained and our integrity never
impaired.
To help our employees to act accordingly a set of mandatory rules have been
implemented. The most important are summarized below:
-

We always comply with laws, regulations and standards that apply to us in our
professional conduct.

-

We do not give or accept bribes as we strive for fair competition,

-

We do not participate in laundering money from criminal activities. This means we
actively document and trace financial transactions with our business partners.

-

We do not pay criminals for protection but we organise protection of our employees
and assets via legalised and recognised companies when needed.

-

We do not give or receive big gifts of any kind still respecting cultural traditions in the
countries where we operate.

-

We accept reluctantly to pay to facilitate minor public services such as visa, however
under a strict reporting and control. In no cases we should pay facilitation payments
for tax and environmental matters or to obtain business contracts.

-

All border line situations or deviations to these rules are to be reported to
management in order to ensure a full transparency within the Group.

This appendix is a summary. The full business ethics policy is published on the Group’s
intranet and contains further details which help our employees to act when they are facing
doubtful situations.

23

Appendix C
Group policy on social responsibility
The Rockwool Group will work in order to continuously improve our social performance by
setting high objectives and integrating social, human rights and health & safety
considerations into our daily business. The Group will maintain an open dialogue with our
stakeholders and report annually on our social performance.

expectations to our suppliers in more detail.
Compliance with Applicable Laws and Standards
We expect our suppliers to comply with all international, national and local laws and
standards relating to employment, environmental, purchasing and manufacturing practises.

aware of these guidelines, but are also committed to uphold the principles set out above.
