In the bank, we believe the greatest contribution
to social responsibility is created when the bank's
core business is in line with society's general
interests, and community responsibility thus
becomes an integral part of the bank's daily
actions.
The Bank's social responsibility, are compared to
4 key stakeholders / areas:
• Customers
• Employees
• Local community and
• Enviroment, climate and societal compliance
The Bank also supports the Parliament’s initiatives
and efforts to bring human rights and climate
impacts high on the social agenda. But as a local
bank, we have a strong locally focus and has
therefore no specific policies in these two areas.
The bank has chosen to publish the statutory
report on corporate social responsibility to its
website.
Thus goals, status and trends in each area are
described annually in an appendix to the bank's
annual report, which all of the bank's
stakeholders
have
access
