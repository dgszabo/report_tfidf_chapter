Report on CSR and gender
distribution
NeuroSearchâ€™s Board of Directors consists of two male
members and one female member, so the Company
maintains an equal gender distribution at the supreme
management level. There is an equal gender distribution at the other management levels, and the Company
consequently does not define policies in this respect.

In view of its size and current activities, NeuroSearch
no longer has:
A policy for corporate social responsibility
A policy for respecting human rights
A policy for reducing the climate impact from
the Company's activities

Working environment
The physical working environment has been simplified
in step with the reduction of activities in NeuroSearch.
After the sale of the domicile property, the address was
changed to an office partnership from where the remaining administration is handled.
