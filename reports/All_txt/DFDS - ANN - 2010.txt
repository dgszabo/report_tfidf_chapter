DFDS Annual Report 2010

28 Human Resources

Human Resources – CSR
The takeover by DFDS of Norfolkline and the integration of
the two organisations provided
the biggest HR challenge of
2010.
Management tools
HR has played an important
role in planning the integration process and helping to
design the new organisation.
Tools were developed for
management to provide them
with the necessary support
and techniques to ensure a
fair and realistic assessment
of the potential candidates for
posts in the new organisation.
The tools were also intended
to ensure that DFDS would be
able to retain key employees,
and to prepare the company’s
management team for change
management.
Support for employees made
redundant
As an inevitable result of
the synergies generated by
integrating the two companies,
the size of DFDS’ workforce
was reduced in 2010. In this
context, an important HR
responsibility has been to
secure the principles, conditions and terms of the redundancy schemes, and to support
departing employees in their
job-seeking endeavours and
prepare them for their future
careers. With these goals in
mind, DFDS offered these
employees appointments
with a so-called outplacement
company, providing support
and tools for job seekers. A
prerequisite was obviously
that the employee in question
was willing to accept this help.

Joint personnel policies
The integration process is
ongoing and is expected to
run until the end of 2012. HR’s
role in this will be to continue
to support staff and managers
in the process by aligning HR
processes and policies across
the organisation. The direct
results of this work include joint
evaluation processes carried out
for land-based staff across the
Group, and the introduction of
common personnel policies.
HR system
As part of the integration process, a project has been initiated
to develop a common IT-based
HR system. Initially, the work
will involve an analysis of the
features that a future IT system
should possess.
Management training and cultural integration
One of the main tasks associated with the HR integration
of DFDS and Norfolkline is to
integrate the two corporate cultures. An important tool in this
cultural integration is the DFDS
Group’s management training
programme ‘ZOOM’, in which
DFDS managers with roots in
either the former Norfolkline or
the former DFDS organisation
can jointly develop as managers
and acquire tools to motivate
and inspire their staff.
79 managers participated in
ZOOM in 2010, and 120 will
participate in 2011. To emphasise the great importance that
DFDS places on developing
management skills and the task
of cultural integration, members of the Group executive

management participate in the
programme in which they talk
about strategies and objectives,
as well as expectations towards
DFDS managers.
The management training
programme is evaluated on an
ongoing basis, and an improvement was achieved in the
course of the year. 2010 saw a
growing understanding among
the participants of the need for
cultural integration between
Norfolkline and DFDS, as well
as between sea and land, in
order to create a new corporate
culture focusing on adaptability
and performance.
“Management means taking responsibility. And taking
responsibility also means taking
responsibility for your employees - not just in their results, but
also in their behaviour and the
culture they create. The most
important management tool
is the manager.” Henrik Holck,
Executive Vice President,
People & Ships
Staff development
An important goal for both
overall HR efforts and the management training programmes
is to provide personal development and skills enhancement
for DFDS staff. That is why each
employee is required to have
a personal development plan.
Every year, all DFDS employees
are offered a so-called Staff
Development Interview, which
focuses on the individual employee’s situation, the relationship between job requirements
and skills and the actual tasks,
and the way in which the

employee functions in his or
her job.
DFDS is a service organisation,
and in the course of the year,
various service courses, professional courses and statutory
courses were held, including
safety training for employees.
A special initiative in 2010 was
a development project for employees working in the galleys
of the passenger ships CROWN
OF SCANDINAVIA and PEARL
OF SCANDINAVIA, in which they
were given an opportunity to
develop their skills and motivation through training courses
held in co-operation with the
Hotel and Catering School. Here
the galley staff learned about
the latest developments in the
arts of cookery and baking, including molecular cooking and
sushi. The project was popular
among the employees and will
continue in 2011.
Students and trainees
Training young people is an
important investment in the
future. Each year, DFDS provides
trainee courses in finances,
shipping, office work and travel.
These two-year programmes
are popular, and all participants
receive a thorough training,
including practical experience
with international co-operation.
Shipping trainees, in particular,
acquire international experience
through a year’s stay at one of
the offices of the DFDS Group
abroad, where, within a secure
environment, they can gain personal experience of the labour
markets and business environments of other countries.

Social initiatives
In 2010, DFDS continued its
co-operation with project “High
Five”, which aims to provide
employment for young people
who have been convicted of
crimes, in order to give them
an opportunity to return to
normal life. DFDS currently
employs five young people on

2009

Diversity
In future, staff composition
must better reflect the society
of which we are a part, as we
thrive and develop through our
differences - for example with
regard to nationality, gender,
age or sexual minority. There
will be a particular focus on
attracting more female managers to DFDS. In 2011, we expect
to implement several targeted
initiatives in this area.

Information
Through rapid, open and
credible communication,
DFDS aims to ensure that its
employees and managers are
informed about the company’s development and strategy, and in particular about
any changes that may affect
the individual employee, and
the reasons for the changes.
The goal is therefore to communicate information about
changes and new initiatives
directly to employees via
internal media or meetings, taking due account of
stock exchange rules, before
the news is announced by
external media or spread by
rumour.

EMPLOYEES PER COUNTRY

RUSSIA

As well as this targeted recruitment of employees, DFDS also
participates in Blue Denmark, a
joint maritime industry project
under the auspices of the Danish
Shipowners’ Association, which
aims to highlight the many good
jobs, managerial positions and
development opportunities offered by the maritime industry.
The main target group is young
people.

The Lauritzen Foundation
In addition to these activities,
DFDS’ majority shareholder,
the Lauritzen Foundation,
makes significant donations
each year to social initiatives. DFDS employees and
their children can also apply
for help from the Foundation,
which provides support for
education, retraining and social purposes. Grants can be
provided to both Danish and
non-Danish staff members.

Recruitment
New DFDS staff members are
often recruited locally in the
various countries, with the
assistance of both recruitment
agencies and the company
website. In addition, there is
an increasing focus on recruiting through popular electronic
media such as Facebook, and
by contact with and special
information campaigns in the
educational institutions.

been sentenced by Danish
courts. DFDS is also participating with a representative in a
special task force to get more
businesses involved in the

In addition to this, DFDS helps to
train young people by providing
valuable and exciting internships, particularly on our ships,
where they can train as ship’s
officers, cooks, waiters, etc.

30 Environmental policy

DFDS’ environmental policy – CSR
DFDS is committed to reducing
its energy consumption and
impact on the environment by
improving its operations and
activities on an ongoing basis.
We will regularly record and
analyse our energy consumption and environmental
impact, and disseminate
information about DFDS’ environmental policy among our
staff in order to ensure a high
degree of awareness about
environmental issues.
We will continuously develop and extend our technical
expertise in order to secure
constant progress in the
direction of more sustainable
operations.
Environmental report
Much of DFDS’ impact on the
surrounding environment is
associated with the operation of
marine vessels and the Group’s
environmental work is therefore
focused on reducing emissions
from ships, as well as on developing and implementing new
environmental technology for
use at sea.
Environmental work at sea
The marine environment is protected by national and international laws and regulations, and
DFDS respects and supports the
continued development of rules
designed to make shipping more
sustainable.
Reducing emissions
DFDS is focused on reducing the
emission of harmful substances
in connection with the use
of fuel by marine engines. In

particular, the work is directed
at cutting emissions of CO2,
NOx, SOx and particles into the
atmosphere.

BUNKER CONSUMPTION PER NAUTICAL MILE FOR THE DFDS FLEET, 2007-2010
(AVERAGE FUEL CONSUMPTION G/GT/NM)

CO2: Fuel oil consumption is
measured daily on all ships, and
is reported and analysed continuously with a view to drawing up reports on consumption
trends for each ship, each route
area and the fleet as a whole.
In 2007, DFDS set the goal of
reducing Co2 emissions by 10%
over a five-year period, based on
consumption per capacity unit
(measured in GT: Gross Tons) per
nautical mile.

6.2

In 2010, the consumption of
bunkers per GT per nautical mile
was 3.6% lower than in 2009
(excluding Norfolkline). Since
2007, consumption has fallen
by 7.9%, and DFDS is thus well
under way to achieving the goal
of a 10% reduction in energy
consumption over five years.
In this context it is important to
emphasise that the measurements are calculated per capacity unit, as the total consumption
changes every time ships are
added to the fleet or laid up, or
routes are acquired or sold. Total
consumption thus fell markedly
from 2008 to 2009 as a result
of lower activity during the
financial crisis, while consumption rose overall in 2010 due to
the acquisition of Norfolkline
and the consequent expansion
of the fleet and increased activity in the market.
The reductions in fuel consumption and thereby emissions can
be attributed to DFDS’ bunkersaving programme, one element

of which is reducing ship speed,
which is a key factor in reducing
consumption and emissions,
while taking into account the
need to maintain an efficient
sailing schedule. In addition,
projects have been initiated to
ensure faster transhipment in
ports, thereby reducing time
spent in port and allowing sailing time to be increased. Further
initiatives include optimising
machinery and engine power,
and better voyage planning
using new technology that calculates the most energy-optimal
route with the help of information on wind, ocean currents,
water depth, wave height and
direction.
Efforts are also being made to
reduce the amount of ballast
water kept on board and to
optimise the ship’s trim, taking
account of draught and speed.
On two passenger vessels, new
propellers are being installed
with a modern design that is

optimised for the speed of the
route. Other initiatives include
utilisation of waste heat and
frequent hull cleanings to reduce
water resistance, together
with a range of measures to
cut electricity consumption in
lighting, heating and ventilation
on board.
Information and motivation
Another major element in these
efforts involves motivating staff
to save energy through more appropriate behaviour and the use
of new technology. Motivation
is encouraged by distributing
more information on environmental policies and goals, and
by involving on-board managers
in the drafting of objectives,
resources and plans. Structured
sharing of knowledge and best
practices is also utilised with
the aim of reducing energy
consumption.

DFDS Annual Report 2010

Consolidation in larger ships
The most effective way to
reduce energy consumption,
and thereby CO2 emissions, is to
replace older vessels with new
ships equipped with modern,
more energy-efficient engines,
and to carry freight on fewer,
but larger ships. In 2009 the
ro-ro vessels TOR FICARIA, TOR
BEGONIA and TOR FREESIA were
extended by 30 metres, which
increased their cargo capacity
from approximately 3,800 lane
metres to approximately 4,600
lane metres. Despite a capacity increase of more than 20%,
the ships’ energy consumption
increased only marginally, while
CO2 emissions per lane metre
have been significantly reduced.
Sulphur (SOx): The amount of
sulphur emitted from ships is
dependent on the amount of
fuel oil burned and the sulphur
content of the oil. In 2010, two
directives entered into force,
issued by the IMO and the EU
respectively, concerning the
use of low-sulphur fuel in the
Baltic Sea and North Sea, both
of which have been designated
ECAs (Emission Control Areas).
From 1 January 2010, the
maximum permissible sulphur
content of fuel oil used during
port calls has been 0.1%. As a
result, sulphur emissions to the
environment during port calls
have been reduced to very low
levels. From 1 July 2010, the
maximum permissible sulphur
content in fuel oil was reduced
from 1.5% to 1.0% for shipping
in the Baltic Sea and North Sea
generally.
Remarks on future
sulphur regulations
It has also been decided to introduce a new set of regulations
from 1 January 2015 which
will further reduce to 0.1% the
maximum permissible sulphur
content in fuel bunker for ships
throughout the Baltic Sea and
North Sea.

Environmental policy 31

DFDS supports general initiatives which aim to reduce emissions of harmful substances into
the surrounding environment,
but it is the view of DFDS, in
common with other operators
in the Baltic Sea and North Sea,
that the planned regulations to
come into force in 2015 would
in their present form bring about
several undesirable consequences which were not taken into
account when these regulations
were adopted. The considerable
price difference between fuel
oil with 1.0% and 0.1% sulphur
content, respectively, will impose extra costs on shipping of
such a magnitude that a number
of routes operating in competition with land-based transport
corridors are likely to close.
Consequently, a substantial
proportion of the volume currently being transported by sea
will thereafter be transported
over land.
An environmental analysis
conducted on behalf of the
Danish Shipowners’ Association
shows that by far the greatest
impact on sulphur emissions is
achieved by reducing the sulphur content in fuel from 1.0%
to 0.5%, while the extra benefit
of further lowering the sulphur
content from 0.5% to 0.1% is
extremely limited. At the same
time, the cost of fuel oil rises
exponentially for oil with 0.1%
sulphur. DFDS therefore wishes
the forthcoming regulations
to be revised so that they will
not have the undesirable side
effect of shifting large volumes
of freight transport from sea to
land. DFDS, together with the
Danish Shipowners’ Association
and other operators in the Baltic
Sea and North Sea, is conducting dialogue with the relevant
authorities on this issue.
New environmental
technology
Technology to reduce the
sulphur content of bunker fuels
on board ships is also under

development. DFDS is collaborating with Aalborg Industries
and MAN Diesel to develop a
so-called ‘scrubber’, which so far
has been produced in a single
test model. This test model is an
approximately 30-ton installation built into the exhaust system of TOR FICARIA, where, in
preliminary tests, it successfully
removed almost 100% of the
sulphur and 70% of the particles
from emissions. The technique
may provide an alternative to
the use of bunkers with low
sulphur content, as the scrubber
is expected to be able to reduce
sulphur emissions to at least
the same level. The test period
has not yet been concluded,
and the scrubber is still under
development. Scrubbers cannot,
however, be used on all ships,
and the device is not expected
to be ready for use before 2015.
NOx: Marine engines expel varying amounts of NOx (nitrogen
oxides) during combustion. The
amount emitted is dependent
on the combustion temperature,
and newer engines are designed
to operate at temperatures
which reduce NOx. Emissions
are therefore lower on modern
vessels, such as TOR FIONIA,
TOR JUTLANDIA, TOR CORONA
and TOR HAFNIA . NOx is a particular problem for local areas
near port terminals, for which
reason ships calling at terminals
close to urban and residential
centres in Oslo and Copenhagen
use catalytic converters to clean
the exhaust gases from their
auxiliary engines, which generate electrical power on board.
Six vessels built in Flensburg
in 2003 and 2004 also have
auxiliary engines equipped with
catalytic converters.
Another way to reduce emissions of harmful substances
while in port is to make use of
land-based electrical power,
which can only be done where
special power couplings are
available on the quay. This

possibility is currently being
assessed, e.g. in Gothenburg, in
collaboration with the port company. Concurrently with this,
several options for environmentally-friendly on-board power
production are currently being
evaluated.
Certification
DFDS has subsidiaries in several
Northern European countries,
and does not currently have
common environmental certification for the entire Group, but
various forms of certification in
the various companies. DFDS
therefore aims to establish a
joint environmental certification.
Responsible scrapping
It is DFDS’ policy to sell ships
for scrap only when it can be
guaranteed that the scrapping
will take place in accordance
with national and international
legislation, and in harmony with
the intentions of the Hong Kong
Convention agreed in October
2009 under the auspices of
the IMO. The latter is an as yet
unratified set of international
regulations aimed at ensuring responsible ship scrapping
in future, and is expected to
enter into force in 2013. DFDS
supports this convention and
other initiatives which, in the
meantime, are designed to ensure that ships are scrapped in a
responsible manner with regard
to both the natural environment
and the working environment.
This policy was the basis of the
sale in early 2010 of a ro-ro
ship, TOR ANGLIA, for scrapping
at the environmentally-certified
Jiangmen Yinhu Shipyard in
China.
