Corporate social responsibility
Zealand Pharma has no explicit policy
covering corporate social responsibility.
However, in it day to day activities the
Company strives to act according to high
standards in areas such as: environment,
working environment, suppliers etc.

Environment
Zealand Pharma is focused on research
and development of biopharmaceutical
drugs and have no production facilities so
the Company’s consumption of energy and
other natural resources and its discharges
of substances into air and water are limited.
The Company complies with applicable
legal requirements when it comes to
handling chemicals and other hazardous
substances.
Working environment
Zealand Pharma aims to be an attractive
employer offering a workplace that is safe
and offers a good work place satisfaction
to our employees. In order to continuously
improve there are two employee elected
committees, a liason committee (samarbejdsudvalg) and a work environment committee (arbejdsmiljøudvalg) overviewing
safety and work environment and suggesting improvements.
