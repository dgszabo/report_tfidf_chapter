Employees, environment
and safety

In the course of the financial year,ALK-Abelló increased its staff to 1432employees. The increase was mainly insales and marketing in connection with thelaunch of GRAZAX®, and in research anddevelopment of the tablet-based vaccinesin the company’s pipeline.ALK-Abelló is continuing its competencedevelopment projects for managers andemployees. In 2007, ALK-Abelló conducteda global management evaluation to documentthe effect of the existing developmentprojects and to identify future areasof focus.In spite of the growing demand for qualifiedemployees, ALK-Abelló continued to besuccessful in filling vacancies with competentcandidates.ALK-Abelló’s systematic efforts to constantlyenhance the working environmentand reduce the impact on the external environmentwere recognized in 2007 as thecompany was awarded two certifications,one in the environmental area (ISO 14001)and one in the health and safety area (OH-SAS 18001).
These certifications document that thecompany has established a simple andeasily understandable, integrated safety,health and environmental system which, inaddition to Denmark, covers the productionsites in Madrid (Spain), Vandeuil and Varennes(France) and Port Washington, RoundRock, Spokane and Spring Mills (USA).As in previous years, the company did notviolate any legal requirements during thefinancial year, including environmental requirements;and no violations of environmentalapprovals or unintended spills occurredduring the year.
