ALK’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

ALK is committed to furthering professionalism, honesty and integrity in all
aspects of the company and in our relationships with customers, employees,
shareholders, society, suppliers and
partners. Therefore, the Code of Conduct, a set of guidelines describing ALK’s
policy in the field of CSR, was established
in 2009. The Code of Conduct describes
the requirements we have established
for our own actions and behaviours and
is based on the UN Global Compact’s 10
principles in the areas of human rights,
labour, environment and anti-corruption.
Since it was launched, the Code of
Conduct has been translated into several
local languages and presented to all
employees. A copy is handed out to all

new employees as part of their introduction to ALK.
ALK’s strategy plan includes specific
action points for the further development
of ALK’s CSR activities based on the Code
of Conduct.
Employees and society
In ALK, we have a long tradition of working systematically to improve working environment and environmental conditions,
supported by the local SHE organisations
(Safety, Health, Environment), which are
located at all production sites. ALK in
Denmark has been health and safety certified (OHSAS 18001) and environmentally certified (ISO 14001) in Denmark
since 2007.

The production sites in Spain, France,
the USA and Canada comply with the
SHE standards and all production sites
cooperate closely to be able to provide
safe and healthy working conditions
and minimise the environmental impact
from our business, irrespective of the
location of the site. The production site
in the Netherlands was acquired in 2010
and will be integrated in the Group’s SHE
activities.
Being focused and setting goals is important to ALK. In 2009, Management
therefore adopted global and long-term
goals for the SHE-related activities focusing on well-being at work and reduction
of energy consumption, including CO2
emissions.

Overview of ALK’s organisational development processes


Organisational, leadership and
employee development
Every two years, ALK performs a global
leadership assessment of all managers
followed by a verbal feedback procedure.
The outcome is a personal development
plan for each manager. On the individual
level, the purpose of the leadership
assessment is to help managers define
their strengths and development areas
and lay the foundations of individual
development plans. For the company


In recognition of a growing pressure at
work and the importance of the psychosocial work environment, attention is
focused on these matters. As competent,
well-functioning and committed employees constitute ALK’s most important
resource, ALK makes a targeted effort to
ensure a dynamic and attractive environment for our employees, which will also
enhance professional and personal
development.

ALK will continue to be a safe and healthy
workplace, and fortunately it is rare for
employees to be physically injured at
work. The number of accidents and absence days are low. See table ‘CSR – key
figures’. To keep this level low, accidents
not leading to absence and near accidents will continue to be analysed.

The general trend is for energy consumption to increase. Among other things this
is due to increases in production. If the
above goals are to be attained in 2014,
it is therefore necessary to take special measures to save energy. In 2010,
a number of specific energy-saving
projects were implemented within lighting, insulation, ventilation and control of
equipment.

To our shareholders

Organisational reviews are carried out every year. The leadership assessments, the overall employee
survey and the strategy process are conducted every two years.

as a whole, the leadership assessment
is used to direct overall leadership
development initiatives. The most recent
leadership assessment was carried out
in the second half of 2010.
Organisational reviews are performed
every year to determine whether our
strategic goals are aligned with the resources available to the various departments of the company. Based on these
reviews, various initiatives are taken,
such as development and safeguarding
of business critical competencies, talent
development and career planning.

In 2010, ALK decided to focus on a
further strengthening of its performance
culture to set a clear direction and
create focus throughout the organisation. The first step is to reconcile the
goals horizontally. The goals are
subsequently cascaded down to individual target agreements. Finally, a
strengthened performance culture is
ensured by developing and motivating
employees through formal and informal
feedback based on the strategic goals.
All managers in ALK have participated in
workshops to enhance this performance
process.

Consumption and emissions in 2008 will be adjusted in terms of establishment of new production sites, closure of old production sites, acquisitions etc.
in accordance with the principles of the global Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

Suppliers and partners
Reliable suppliers and partners are
indispensable for ALK, and ALK encourages its suppliers and partners to adhere
to the standards for doing business that
are described in our Code of Conduct.

This process is continued in 2011 through
focus on the delegation of responsibility
throughout the organisation for decisionmaking processes to be as decentralised
and qualified as possible. This implies a
further strengthening and implementation of the management model and a
clarification of what is expected at each
management level in connection with the
management processes.

Safety, health and environmental issues
have traditionally been dealt with in the
SHE organisation, while employee and
leadership development as well as employee satisfaction surveys have been a
matter for Human Resources. In order to
strengthen collaboration and in recognition of the many overlaps, CSR/SHE
became an organisational part of Human
Resources in 2010.

The employees’ general welfare and
views on the company’s performance
are measured every two years in a global
employee survey, which will be conducted again in 2011 focusing particularly
on development in the results relating to
professional and personal development
as well as cross-organisational collaboration. Considered against the results
from 2009, ALK wishes to remain a workplace where employees experience focus
on their development and career, and we
want to strengthen collaboration across
departments and national borders.

Customers
ALK’s mission is to improve quality of life
by developing pharmaceuticals that treat
the actual cause of allergy instead of just
relieving symptoms. This is considered
a responsible way of managing allergic diseases from patient and society
perspectives – not least because allergy
vaccination potentially prevents the
development of additional allergies and
has been demonstrated to prevent the
development of asthma.

The SHE issues are routinely evaluated in
connection with all large investments, and
suppliers complete a questionnaire about
their performance in working environment
and environmental conditions. This review
forms part of the decision-making when
choosing suppliers.
Outlook for the future
It is not a matter of course that the many
good intentions of the Code of Conduct
are anchored with and acted out by ALK’s
employees without an active effort. Focus
will thus continue to be on the launch of
initiatives to ensure the anchoring of the
principles in the organisation.
