Corporate Responsibility

MANAGEMENT REVIEW

Climate and environmental
achievements 2016
Greentech recognises the responsibility attached
to being a player in society in a local, national
and international context. Therefore, Greentech
remains attentive towards making targeted efforts
to ensure that its core business area and activities
are conducted in a financially, environmentally
and socially viable manner by both complying
with statutory requirements and taking voluntary
corporate responsibility initiatives in the countries and
communities in which Greentech operates. Greentech
believes that responsible business behaviour is a
precondition for long-term value creation for the
Company and its stakeholders.

Climate and environment

The UN principles on human rights, labour rights,
environment and anticorruption form a guiding
framework on which Greentech’s corporate
responsibility efforts are based. In its considerations
relating to Corporate Responsibility initiatives,
Greentech seeks inspiration in the UN Global Compact
initiative for corporate social responsibility.

Greentech contributed production of renewable
energy provides immediate environmental
advantages in terms of savings of fossil fuels and
elimination of CO2 emissions.

Greentech directly addresses significant societal
challenges through the Company’s core business of
producing and selling renewable energy from wind
and solar technologies, contributing to reduce the
environmental and climate impact.
Based on a durable and profitable portfolio of
renewable energy producing assets, Greentech strives
to generate and distribute clean energy production in
order to preserve the environment and to contribute
to a world sustainable growth.

In 2016, the gross production generated by
Greentech’s operating assets supplied more than
148,000 families with non-polluting energy and saved
the consumption of more than 600,000 barrels of oil.
Also, Greentech’s 2016 clean energy gross
production corresponded to a reduction of approx.
236,000 tons CO2 – equalling the elimination of
emissions from more than 98,000 cars.

MANAGEMENT REVIEW

As Greentech offers an alternative to the scarce and
polluting power sources providing clean energy without
emissions of hazardous particles or greenhouse gases,
no special environmental risks are related to Greentech’s
activities.

maintenance of the plants during their 25-year lifetime.
Having compensated any related generation of pollution
and CO2 after 15 months, Greentech’s wind turbines,
averagely, deliver a pure energy production during 95%
of their lifespan.

The Company, however, do care about the physical
impact of its activities. Greentech’s projects are subject
to environmental permits and at all project stages
Greentech is governed by comprehensive environmental
legislation and rules which, through mandatory surveys
and analyses, safeguard the surroundings of the
Company’s plants, i.e. flora and fauna, local households
and the landscape.

Greentech’s operating solar projects are energy neutral
within 37 months from the first connection. With an
expected lifespan of 20 years, the solar assets provide
fully clean energy during 85% of their lifespan.

Greentech has no significant outstanding environmental
issues with authorities, nongovernmental organisations
or local households.

As to limit also the environmental impact of the
Company’s administrative activities, Greentech decided,
starting from 2014, not to present the annual report in a
printed and bound version, but only electronically.
On average, Greentech’s wind operating assets
are energy neutral within 15 months from the first
connection - their “energy payback time”. This means
that within 15 months of operation, the turbines have
generated the same amount of energy that has been
or will be consumed for the development, construction,

People

Diversity in management

professional and personals skills and competences.

Greentech considers diversity an important asset and
remains committed to ensuring equal opportunities and
rights for employees and therefore does not tolerate
discrimination or harassment based on religion, race,
ethnicity, gender, age, sexuality, political opinion or other
status.

Greentech also maintains focus on encouraging
diversity at managerial levels, an initiative which
was introduced in 2013 with the policy on equal
representation in management centred on gender
distribution in the Board of Directors. In line with
section 139a of the Danish Companies Act, the Board
of Directors, thus, has implemented a target figure for
the proportion of women, who currently constitute
the underrepresented sex of the Board:

In 2016, 2 male members of the Board of Directors
withdrew, reducing the Board from seven to five
members. With Greentech’s Board of Directors currently
consisting of five members – 4 male and 1 female – the
ratio of the underrepresented sex on the Board has
increased from 14% to 20%.

Greentech has a diverse workforce with a broad
employee composition in terms of geographical and
cultural background, gender and age distribution
(see the paragraph “Organisation” for details on the
composition of the employees).
Moreover, a safe and healthy workplace continues to be
a priority for Greentech. Particularly in the
Company’s wind and solar plants, severe health and
safety procedures are implemented to secure the
employees and minimise the risk of occupational
accidents. Also in 2016, these provisions have
contributed to an injury- and incident-free working
environment.

It is the aim of the Board of Directors of Greentech
that 2 female board members be elected by the
General Meeting before the end of 2017.
Greentech’s Board of Directors has been ambitious
on the topic taking an important step towards its
fulfilment with the election of Mrs. Michèle Bellon
as member of the Board of Directors at the Annual
General Meeting already in April 2014. Despite a
continued process and focused effort identifying
competent and qualified female candidates, the right
match has not been made yet. The target figure,
therefore, most likely will not be met as planned. The
Board of Directors will, however, continue its efforts
towards its fulfilment within the shortest possible time
frame, maintaining obviously the primary criteria that
the candidates proposed for the Board of Directors
are selected considering their suitability based on

Additionally, the Company has adopted policies
regarding the proportion of gender in the other
management levels of the Company:
Greentech is still committed to working towards creating
and maintaining equal opportunities for women and
men at all management levels in the Company. In
connection with all recruitment, including recruitment
at management level, it is Greentech’s policy to fulfil
the Company’s requirements for employees with the
necessary skills and competences, regardless of gender,
age, ethnicity etc.
When choosing between equally qualified candidates,
the diversity among the employees shall be taken
into consideration. In connection with recruitment
for managerial positions it should be ensured, where
possible, that the candidates invited for interview include
both men and women.
At year-end 2016, the managerial positions below
top-management level in the Company were covered

by respectively 50% (58% including “discontinued
operations”) male managers and 50% (42% including
“discontinued operations”) female managers – a totally
equal gender representation.

Ethics and behaviour

the Group companies which addresses relevant issues
and prescribes the correct behaviour in interactions
with the Company’s internal and external stakeholders.
A system to increase awareness and of empowerment
among the employees regarding the rules of conduct
and business ethics has been implemented.

Transparency and compliance with national and
international regulation and standards are considered
cornerstones in Greentech’s business behaviour, and
the Company is committed to conduct its activities in a
lawful and conscientious way and perform its practices
responsibly with due consideration and respect of
internal and external procedures and guidelines.
A code of ethics has been introduced for the majority of

Greentech operates in an international context, currently
in five different European countries (Denmark, Germany,
Italy, Poland and Spain) which all constitute fairly limited
risk factors in terms of businesses’ exposure to human
rights violations. Consequently, Greentech does not
conduct any activities, liaise or contract with business
partners or suppliers in countries considered high-risk in
terms of negatively impacting human rights.

Greentech has not prepared a specific policy on human
rights as, so far, the Company has not deemed it
relevant, considering its business activities and locations.
In the future, Greentech will continuously endeavour to
expand its corporate responsibility efforts by integrating
environmental and social aspects in its planning and
decision-making processes. These efforts will be based
on the topics most relevant with respect to Greentech’s
core business and commercial goals as this is the best
way in which Greentech can contribute through relevant
initiatives to the benefit of the Company and of its
stakeholders.
