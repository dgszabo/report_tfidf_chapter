business in Eastern Jutland - both directly and
indirectly to create value for society.

Corporate Social Responsibility
The Bank's CSR policy
The Bank's five values, together with the Bank's
environmental policy, are the foundation of the
Bank's ongoing CSR effort.

The Bank’s contributes indirectly by tying
investments and financing together for app.
39,500 private customers and 3,325 business

the market area.

The five values are:

•
•
•
•

Team, well-being and safety
Committed and effective
Active customer advice
Sound economy
Local and visible

Some of the Bank's operating expenses are
settled as revenue in a number of local businesses, and the Bank's some 185 employees also
help generate revenue and growth in the local
area.

These values are key to the Bank's management,
and the employees are expected to live by these
in their day-to-day work and decision-making.
The values are described below in conjunction
with the four key stakeholder areas in relation to
the Bank's CSR effort:
