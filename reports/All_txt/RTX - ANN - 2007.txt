Therefore, the Group’s impact on environment is in all materiality indirect, and in-house it is restricted to electricity and
heating as well as insignificant chemical consumption.
The Group encourages its sub-suppliers to use environmentally
acceptable raw materials and products and to observe directives governing the environmental production and handling of
electronic equipment (the RoHS and WEEE directives).
