Code of Conduct

Code of Conduct
For many years, Gabriel has applied a Code of Conduct
ensuring that its products do not contain any environmentally dangerous or harmful substances to the detriment of
its users. At the same time, it is an invariable requirement
that all employees engaged in service functions and production have a safe working environment, which is realised by vendor audits.
Gabriel complies with the Code of Conduct prepared by
Gabriel‘s trade association, Danish Fashion and Textile.
Additionally, Gabriel is also a member of the association‘s
CSR committee. The standard contains 13 principles and
is available at www.gabriel.dk.
Environment
Environmental management is an important tool to
strengthen competitiveness. Gabriel‘s environmental
management is governed by ISO 14001, EMAS, the EU
Flower eco-label scheme and Oeko-Tex. In addition, during the year under review, Gabriel worked on cradle-tocradle certification.
Gabriel ensures compliance with the European Community Regulation on chemicals and their safe use, REACH, in
close co-operation with vendors of chemicals and dyes.
During the 2009/10 financial year, Gabriel will lay down
guidelines for a reduction in its emission of greenhouse
gases.
Quality
Gabriel‘s quality management is governed by ISO 9001.
One of the primary tasks in 2008/09 was to maintain the
usual standard for quality and environmental management
when dyeing and finished were outsourced to Scandye
UAB. Gabriel has been successful in this respect seen in
relation to the changes prompted by the relocation of production.
Vendor co-operation
Driven by the annual admittance of new vendors, Gabriel
has focused its efforts on partnerships actively complying
with all requirements in terms of environment, quality and
CSR.
