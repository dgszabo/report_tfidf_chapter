Corporate Social Responsibility
Since its foundation, UIE has invested in the agro-industrial sector, particularly palm oil.
Because we invest in companies that depend on natural resources, we have an inherited
interest to act in environmental and social responsible manners, and hereby secure the longterm basis for our business.
As a listed investment holding company, we strive to attain acceptable long-term returns,
while maintaining the important balance between economy and care. We believe that
the best way to do this is to invest in companies that are operated and developed in an
environmentally and socially responsible manner.
We support the implementation of corporate social responsibility in our associated
companies by close dialogue with their managements on strategic and operational issues,
and we expect our associated companies to;
•
•
•

protect the environment and natural resources by applying environmentally responsible
production methods;
secure the well-being of their employees by providing good and safe working conditions;
and
uphold human rights and be responsible members of the communities they are part of.

To have true impact, UIE believes that corporate social responsibility should be carried out
locally and in ways suited to meet the actual needs on ground. Thus, to allow for such
flexibility, the environmental and social aspects relevant for our associated companies are
addressed individually in their CSR policies. A detailed account of our associated companies’
CSR commitments can be found in their annual reports, sustainability reports and websites.
The following CSR highlights from the associated companies’ CSR policies clearly illustrate
that corporate social responsibility is an integral part of these companies’ core businesses.

UP: The Kingham-Cooper
Endangered Tree Species
Reserve at the UIE Estate has
to date a total of 11,500 tropical trees constituting about 250
diverse tree species. This will
become a valuable source of
seeds that will be used to establish additional areas with these
endangered trees and thereby
create a true bio-diversity of
tree species at UP.

UP:
UP’s CSR policy focuses on continuous care, commitment and responsibility towards its
employees, the environment, the community and marketplaces in which it operates. UP
remains committed to conducting business in a manner that achieves sustainable growth
while maintaining a high degree of social and environmental responsibility. In 2010, a CSR
sub-committee was established (an extension to the existing Environment Management
Committee) to formalise and take charge of necessary and relevant CSR topics.
Environmental commitments
•

UP is committed to continuously reducing the environmental impact of its operations by
implementing new and greener technologies.

•

UP was the fi rst producer of palm oil in the world to obtain certification for sustainable
palm oil production in accordance with the principles and criteria of the Roundtable on
Sustainable Palm Oil (“RSPO”). Since UP’s certification a total of 43 companies have
obtained RSPO certification. In 2011, the Indonesian Government implemented a
mandatory certification scheme called the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil’s (“ISPO”)
Principles & Criteria to ensure that all producers in Indonesia within a few years comply
with the scheme. UP plans to have commenced the ISPO certification at its Indonesian
estates no later than in 2015.

•

In December 2010, UP’s refi nery in Malaysia, Unitata, received its RSPO Supply Chain
Certification which means that Unitata handles and delivers fi rst class, sustainably,
certified and segregated palm and palm kernel oil solutions to customers worldwide.

•

In October 2011, UP reaped the benefits of its work on CSR, as the company was
presented with the prize for the best CSR practice in Malaysia. The prize is only presented
every second year, and honors companies’ contribution to and positive impact on the
employees, environment and local communities as a whole.

•

In 2006, UP inaugurated the world’s fi rst fully integrated plantation-based biomass
boiler and biogas plant, and has since then constructed three biogas plants in Malaysia.
Combined, these four plants have reduced the emission of CO2 by 70% and CH4 by 80%
at the respective operating units. The plants have all been certified as Clean Development
Mechanism Projects (“CDM”).

•

In 2008, the world’s fi rst comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (“LCA”), in accordance
with the ISO 14040 and 14044 International Standards, was conducted at UP, covering
the entire palm oil production chain. The LCA was renewed in May 2011 and again in
2012. The ongoing updates of the LCA reports (the latest in 2012) continues to provide
UP with a comprehensive and clear overview of the results of the company’s efforts to
reduce its carbon footprint, and helps to identify areas where further improvements can
be made. When compared to the 2005 levels, the LCA shows that the current four CDM
projects have helped to reduce the annual emissions of green house gasses by a minimum
of 125,000 MT CO2 (eq). Thereby, the company has met its target of reducing the carbon
footprint per ton of refi ned palm oil produced by 40% by 2012, compared to year 2005
level. The construction of a biogas plant in UP’s Indonesian estates further reaffi rms
UP’s commitment towards reducing its green house gas emissions. The plant will be the
fi rst of its kind in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, and is expected to be commissioned by
April 2013.

Today, all of UP’s palm oil mills are self-sufficient with energy and produce steam and
electricity used elsewhere in the operations.

•

UP is continuously working towards a dynamic and innovative waste management and
utilization system aimed at achieving zero waste. The programme includes among
others:
•

•
•

Recycling biomass residue from field and mill operations as organic matter or
as fuel source to enrich the soil and reduce the use of fossil fuels. In 2011, the
total organic matter recycled on land in UP amounted to 538,670 tonnes with a
carbon content of 215,468 tonnes, whereas in 2012, the recycled matter increased
to 621,853 tonnes, with a carbon content of 248,471 tonnes.
Harvesting rain water.
Monitoring domestic water consumption at all facilities.

UP is committed to increase the use of eco-friendly and natural insecticides in the
plantations to phase out or reduce the use of pesticides. For many years, UP has been
working towards minimizing or phasing out the use of pesticides via implementing the
following key components of its Integrated Pest Management Programme (“IPM”):
•

•
•

•

•

Planting beneficial plants to enhance the natural parasitic and predator activities
against bagworm and other pests. Over the past five years, the number of beneficial
plants has increased five-fold and to-date more than 169,000 beneficial flowering
plants have been planted. In 2012 alone, approximately 31,000 beneficial plants
were planted.
Pheromone traps for biological control of rhinoceros beetle.
Installation of barn owl boxes to attract barn owls which are used as a fi rst line
defence against the damaging rat population in the plantations. A pair of barn
owls can consume up to 800 rats per year, and as there are approx. 1,700 pairs of
barn owls at the estates, they consume approx. 1.4 million rats per year. This has
reduced the pesticides used to fight the rat population significantly.
On-going monitoring and aerial surveillance is carried out to better detect, preempt and treat potential pest outbreaks before they become too serious (treatment
is only carried out when the damage exceeds established critical thresholds).
First line of treatment against leaf pests is by biological treatment in the form of
Bacillus Thuringiensis.

•

Today, UP’s use of pesticides is 6-7 times lower per tonne produced oil, compared to
rapeseed farmers, and about 49-54 times lower compared to soybean oil farmers and
sunflower oil farmers.

•

More than 5,500 hectares have been set aside for conservation purposes (jungle reserves,
wildlife sanctuaries and green corridors) to encourage biodiversity and wildlife on UP’s
estates. In Malaysia, the preserved areas represent approximately 10% of UP’s total
planted area. In Indonesia, preserved jungle areas constitute approximately 35% of UP’s
total area.

•

To develop effective conservation strategies, UP and Copenhagen Zoo have entered into
a formal partnership, and on 1 October 2010, a Memorandum of Understanding (“MoU”)
was signed between the two parties. The MoU included establishing a Biodiversity
Department as part of the Lada Estate field office in Indonesia. In September 2011, the
department officially opened, and currently has six employees. The department identified
and listed all environmental, mapping and social challenges, and have made proposals
on how to address and overcome the challenges. The main focus areas were identified to
be the following:
•
•
•
•

Forestry and rehabilitation
Biodiversity and baseline information
Geographical Information System (“GIS”) and mapping
Communication and mainstreaming

Forestry and rehabilitation: A tree nursery has been established for endangered
species at Lada Estate. To date, the nursery stocks about 10,000 seedlings,
representing more than 18 different native tree species. This program will be
expanded during 2013 to Runtu Estate.
Biodiversity and baseline information: Camera traps have confi rmed the existence
of several primate species at conservation areas in Runtu and Umpang Estates,
including orangutans, proboscis monkeys, silvered langurs, maroon langurs,
Bornean gibbons, pig-tailed macaques, and long-tailed macaques. The cameras
also revealed the Malaysian sun bear, sambar deer and leopard cats at UP’s
estates. It is a priority for UP that the natural habitats of the wildlife at UP’s estates
are respected and protected.
GIS and mapping: Significant progress has been made, as regards development
of necessary infrastructure to ensure the department’s full operation. The
department provides quality environmental and GIS information, based on
national and international laws and RSPO’s requirements.
Communication and mainstreaming: Communication between the biodiversity
department and the plantation operations has improved significantly. Integration
of the biodiversity department and environmental issues/concerns into standard
management and operational processes is also improving, but is an ongoing
process.

The Kingham-Cooper Endangered Tree Species Reserve established in 2008 continues
to expand, and to date a total of 11,500 tropical trees constituting about 250 diverse tree
species have been planted. Since 2011, 2,000 more trees have been planted and 50 more
species are represented in the reserve. This will become a valuable source of seeds that
will be used to establish additional areas with these endangered trees and thereby create
a true bio-diversity of tree species at UP.

UP: Several thousand monitor lizards live on UP’s oil palm plantations
living of frogs, rats, water-hens etc. They can grow right up to a length
of 2.2 meters and thrive in the oil palm habitat.

UP: It is the year of the snake according to the Chinese calender. On
UP’s estates there are a variety of snakes (both venemous and nonvenemous snakes). This picture taken on Jendarata Estate shows a black
cobra which has raised is hood ready to strike. The snakes belonging to
the cobra family are venemous and incapacitate their prey by injecting a
poison. The black cobra, being carnivorous, generally feed on rats, mice,
frogs, lizards, and birds found on the plantation.

Social and community responsibility
•

Social responsibility and community engagement has been the hallmark of UP
throughout its history and UP strives to be a trusted corporate citizen, and, as an integral
part of society, to fulfi l its responsibilities to the society and community in which it
operates.

•

The social commitment and welfare programmes of UP include well-equipped hospitals
and health clinics, premium housing for employees and families, places of worship such
as temples, mosques and churches, kindergartens, primary schools and old folks homes
for the company’s retirees, etc. During 2012, UP granted 61 scholarships to children of
employees enabling them to pursue tertiary education.

•

Several new staff quarters and modern employee houses were built during 2012, in line
with the company’s goal to provide its employees with the best housing facilities within
the industry.

•

As families, small businesses and organisations grow out of UP’s operations and become
dependant on UP, close bonds with the local communities become UP’s key priority. UP
has therefore taken the initiative to start up Smallholders Field Day. Farmers from the
local districts in Malaysia are invited to the plantation to get a better understanding of
good agricultural practices, sustainability initiatives and environmental protection.
They are trained in safe handling of pesticides, optimal harvesting procedures and
fertilizer application. The programme will steer the farmers away from illegal logging,
slash-and-burn activities etc. and thus help turn this negative impact on the environment
around.

•

In Indonesia, UP has joined a government project called The Plasma Scheme. The
purpose of this project is that established palm oil producers help smallholders to become
independent plantation growers. UP’s role in the project is helping local smallholders in
supplying the necessary resources (including the land being developed), training in
developing oil palm plantations, which includes environmentally responsible land
clearing and cultivation, as well as economic aid. Once developed, the plantation will be
handed over to the smallholder for self-management. During the developing process,
the farmers are employed on normal terms at UP, where they gain experience and
training in best management practices.

•

Occupational health and safety is a fundamental part of all UP’s operations. The health
and safety measures include periodic workplace inspections, regular Safety Committee
meetings, regular medical surveillance, awareness raising and training programmes in
proper use of personal protective equipment.

AAK:
AAK fi nds it important to anchor its CSR efforts in the entire organisation and to
incorporate a sustainability mindset in the everyday working life. AAK’s CSR department
is therefore responsible for handling and communicating CSR related initiatives, progress,
communication, and reporting.
Environmental commitments
•

AAK has been a member of UN Global Compact since January 2003.

•

The company releases an annual sustainability report, in which AAK’s CSR target
figures, strategies and initiatives are described. Its latest report was released in September
2012, covering both 2011 and 2012.

•

AAK is a founding member of the RSPO, and in 2009 two of AAK’s production plants
obtained RSPO supply chain certification, seven in 2010, and today all relevant plants
are certified.

•

AAK has developed and manages the GreenPalm Book&Claim System, which is a
system for trade with RSPO certificates. GreenPalm has been set up to promote the
production of sustainable palm oil by allowing the producers to sell GreenPalm
certificates and earn extra income for their sustainable crops. Retailers, food companies
and other customers can actively support and encourage the production of sustainable
palm oil by buying GreenPalm certificates. The GreenPalm programme has more than
500 members, ranging from growers to end-customers. The GreenPalm Book&Claim
System is further described on page 65.

•

AAK’s operations depend on heat and steam, which makes them relatively energyintensive. The company is therefore committed to continuously increase energy efficiency
by, e.g., using new technology and where possible, increase the use of renewable energy
sources, improving waste management and using environmentally friendly packaging.
Some of AAK’s overall objectives and initiatives to reduce the environmental impact
have resulted in the following:

In 2011, the plant in Aarhus, Denmark reduced its water consumption by 7%.
The plant in Karlshamn, Sweden has in 2011 reduced its energy consumption
by 6%. In the same period, the plant’s use of renewable energy sources has
increased by over 90% and its annual emission of fossil carbon dioxide has been
reduced from around 100 kg/tonnes to nearly zero. In recognition of this, the
plant in Karlshamn has been rewarded with the prestigious E-prize, a Swedish
energy price, awarded by the Swedish Business newspaper Veckans Affärer in
collaboration with energy provider E.ON.
The UK plant has set a goal to reduce steam consumption by 10% and carbon
emissions beyond national targets.
The plant in the Netherlands has installed a wastewater management process that
returns clean water directly to the local waterway.
The plant in New Jersey, USA has reduced energy consumption, effluent and
waste significantly and is currently installing new energy-efficient plants to
reduce energy costs per tonne of product produced even further.
The Mexican plant has made significant progress within energy reduction, waste
management and steam consumption through many small improvement projects.

Social and community responsibility
•

In 2012 AAK continued its long tradition of being an active member of the local
community by sponsoring or actively taking part in local projects, among others:
•

•

•

•

In 2003, AAK entered into a partnership with the United National Development
Programme (“UNDP”) to install a simple diesel engine which generates
electricity and provides energy for various tools, which the women operate in
connection with their work in rural villages in Burkina Faso. The objective was –
and still is – to reduce women’s daily workload and at the same time increase their
opportunities for generating an income. This project was a success and has been
expanded to a national project headed by the government and comprising all of
Burkina Faso. The government’s national goal is to implement a multi-functional
platform in each village. In 2011, 848 platforms had been installed.
AAK is one of the founders of the Global Shea Alliance – an international
organisation, established in October 2010, whose mission is to establish industry
standards for quality and sustainable sourcing and facilitating information
exchange.
AAK is one of the leading consumers of shea kernels that grow in some of the
world’s poorest countries. AAK works directly with the women who collect the
shea kernels, building capacity in local communities. The work in these areas
includes the formation of women’s groups in the villages and teaching the women
how to maintain the quality of the kernels, and how to make the shea supply chain
as short, transparent and efficient as possible. In West Africa, AAK works together
with almost 10,000 women by giving them direct market access to the industrial
consumer of shea kernels without binding them to trade with AAK, whereby they
will obtain a higher price than if they sold to middlemen. Off season the women
have the possibility of obtaining micro loans from AAK instead of being forced
to sell their future collection of kernels to middlemen at low prices. On 23 March
2012, AAK and the government of Burkina Faso signed an agreement engaging
AAK in tripling the activities with the women groups within two years, with the
support of the government. The intention is to increase the number of women and
groups to cover the whole country.
Since 2009, AAK Latin America has supported the non-profit organisation “Un
techo para mi País” (“A roof for my country”). The organisation works together
with the most marginalised populations, constructing transitional homes and
implementing social inclusion programmes to empower slum residents with the
tools to improve their quality of life. AAK and ten other companies took part in
the construction of transitional houses for 35 families in four irregular settlements
(poor urban neighbourhoods without access to basic services) in Montevideo.

The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil
To obtain the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil certification, the palm oil
producer must implement and document compliance with eight principles and
39 criteria stipulated by RSPO. This includes, among others;
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Reduce deforestation
Preserve biodiversity
Respect the livelihoods of rural communities
Ensure that no new or high conservation value forests are converted into palm oil plantations
Respect the basic rights of workers and communities
Implement health and safety measures for employees
Respect the rights of indigenous people

Today, these criteria on sustainability are beyond doubt the worlds strictest for any agricultural crop.
For more information about the RSPO, visit www.rspo.org.

GreenPalm
A certificate trading programme for sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil
It is possible to process and ship sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil separated from
non-sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil. However, only about 15% of the global palm
oil and palm kernel oil is currently certified as sustainable palm oil by RSPO, the physical
segregation of sustainable oil adds cost at every stage.
The GreenPalm programme bypasses the physical supply chain completely as:
•

RSPO certified palm oil producers can register a quantity of their output with the GreenPalm
programme. They are awarded one GreenPalm certificate for each tonne of palm oil which has been
sustainably produced. They can then put those certificates up for sale on the GreenPalm web based
trading platform.

•

Manufacturers or retailers can then bid for and buy those certificates online, in order to be able to
claim that they have supported the production of sustainable palm oil. The payment is made directly
to the palm oil producer. The palm oil itself is sold, processed and purchased in the usual way.

•

By buying a product which bears the GreenPalm logo, consumers can make environmentally
responsible purchasing decisions and make a positive contribution to the production of certified
sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil.

By making or selling products which are covered by the GreenPalm programme food manufacturers
and retailers can reward palm producers for working in a sustainable and responsible way, and tell their
customers that they have done so.
More than five million certificates have now been sold via the GreenPalm trading platform.
