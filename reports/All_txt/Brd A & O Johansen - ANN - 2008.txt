ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUESSince 1999 Brødrene A & O Johansen A/S’s administrationand central warehouse in Albertslundhave been certified against the internationalenvironmental standard called DS/ENISO 14001. The Company’s branch Vaga Teknik,which is situated in Horsens together with thenew logistics centre, has been certified againstthe same standard since 2001.In connection with the annual audit of theCompany’s environmental management system,the following overall objectives for theenvironmental policy were decided upon for2009:- The Company is to recycle more than 60% ofits total waste.- The environmental strain caused by theCompany through its distribution of goods isto be relatively reduced.According to AO’s analyses for 2008 theCompany recycled 72% and 89% of its totalwaste at the central warehouse and at the logisticscentre, respectively. Due to increasingoil prices in 2008, the Company was not ableto fully honour the objective of a relative reductionin the environmental impact caused by theCompany’s distribution of goods.

In 2008, the most important activity related toAO’s environment action plan was to extendthe existing DS/EN ISO 14001 environmentalcertification of Vaga Teknik to include all businessactivities registered at the address of thenew logistics centre in Horsens. This objectivewas accomplished in October 2008.
