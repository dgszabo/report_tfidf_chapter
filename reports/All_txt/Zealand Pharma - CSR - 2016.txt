Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report for 2016
Acting as a responsible part of society is a cornerstone in the way we conduct our business.
Our behavior should benefit the patients we strive to help, our employees, shareholders and
the wider community.
Zealand and CSR
Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) work is an integrated part of Zealand’s business, and the
efforts in this area are based on our core values. We believe that Zealand has an obligation to be socially
responsible in order to benefit not only our main stakeholders, mainly shareholders, patients and
employees, but also society. A key focus for us across our business is to have open, engaging and
respectful communication with all our stakeholders.
Our CSR efforts are based on the most common elements of some of the most widely implemented CSR
initiatives in the world, notably the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the United Nations Global
Compact. Within these two systems, Zealand has found complementary frameworks for both guiding and
reporting its CSR activities, along with several principles in the areas of labor, e environment, human
rights and anticorruption. In addition to these, we have added a provisional category for animal rights,
given the unique requirements of our industry.
Zealand is a Danish biotech company discovering and developing novel peptide-based medicines.
We are passionate about improving patients’ lives and committed to delivering value for all our
stakeholders. We intend to be a world leader in specialty medicines, focusing on metabolic and
gastrointestinal diseases.
Zealand has a successful history of discovering and optimizing peptide therapeutics as novel drugs.
Our pipeline will focus on addressing the needs of patients suffering from gastrointestinal and metabolic
diseases, at the same time as incorporating opportunities in other specialty diseases that match our
competencies and ambitions. We will continue to grow our pipeline through internal research as well as
in licensing and acquisitions.
We intend to realize the value of our drug product candidates ourselves and have significantly
strengthened our competencies to ensure that we can successfully advance products along the clinical
development and registration path. We have built a strong internal setup and secured solid partnership
agreements for clinical trial execution and manufacturing in order to advance our Phase 2 product
candidates: the GLP-2 analogue glepaglutide, targeting short bowel syndrome, and the two glucagon
analogue programs with dasiglucagon. We will engage in commercialization for selected product
candidates, for example glepaglutide. We also intend to gradually expand our commercial capabilities
and establish a local presence in relevant markets.
Successful implementation of our strategy will propel Zealand forward to becoming a fully integrated
biotechnology company, building on our strong R&D platform while expanding relationships with our
customers.

Our CSR focus
We see our corporate social responsibility as an ongoing process that adapts to new ideas and activities
to keep us up to date with developments in this area.
Association for Users of Home Parenteral
At Zealand, we are passionate about improving care for patients and are committed to delivering value
for our shareholders. In our operations, we are socially and environmentally responsible and comply with
relevant laws, standards and guidelines. At the same time, we focus on the well-being of our employees
and encourage actions to minimize our impact on the environment.
Given that Zealand does not currently market or commercialize medicines itself, many issues specific to
the pharmaceutical industry do not fall within the scope of Zealand’s CSR initiatives. As a small company
with only 122 employees, we need to allocate our resources carefully, so adopting a policy on human
rights is not a priority. However, we are aware of and respect the UN Guiding Principles on Business and
Human Rights.
To improve the transparency of our social responsibility, Zealand has elevated CSR matters to senior
management. We see our corporate social responsibility as an ongoing process that adapts to new ideas
and activities to keep us up to date with developments in this area.
Engaging with our community – locally and nationally
We play an active role in the local community. We have established a collaboration with local job
centers to offer “on-the-job training” opportunities at Zealand for refugees in order to strengthen their
integration into Danish society.
To benefit our employees and the environment, we are part of a coalition with other companies,
governmental institutions and municipalities to ensure better access to public transportation.
At national level, we work closely with academic institutions, in various ways, to improve job
opportunities for graduates, for example by offering short-term assignments, internships and mentoring
of master's and Ph.D. students.

Employee well-being, including health, safety and labor practices
Policy and guidelines
At Zealand, employees are our most important resource, and we believe that an engaged, skilled and
motivated workforce results in better-quality work. We work on developing our employees’ competencies,
as knowledge and experience are key to our success as a biotech company. We believe that having an
experienced management team and a talented pool of employees with extensive experience in the
pharmaceutical and biotech industry and diverse backgrounds is the best way to drive performance and
innovative thinking. We have invested in the development of employee competencies, and we regularly
invest in leader training to enhance employee engagement.
Key to our success are the competencies and innovative drive of our employees, along with an
organizational culture and structure that supports open and dynamic interactions across functions.
We work actively to ensure the well-being of our employees. We have numerous policies in place to
ensure the physical and mental health and safety of all employees and of Zealand’s working environment.
We have set up a number of committees, including a Works Council and an Occupational Health and
Safety Committee (OHAS Committee) on which both management and employees are represented and
regularly discuss matters related to our work environment.
Zealand has numerous written procedures in place to support its work environment. When it comes to its
policies, Zealand has taken Danish Labor Law as its starting point and, in some cases, has gone above
Zealand Pharma A/S Statutory report on Corporate Social Responsibility 2016

4/11

and beyond what is required of public companies in order to be more considerate of and responsive to
the needs of its workforce. These policies are described in an Employee Handbook which, among other
things, details the different forms of leave available and the rules on health and alcohol consumption.
Our policies on occupational health and safety (OHAS) are described in a separate manual which
emphasizes the high priority that Zealand gives to the work environment.
General health and well-being at Zealand are also taken seriously, and the Company makes it easier for
its employees to stay healthy by providing gym and exercise facilities as well as healthy food options.
Health insurance is offered to all employees.
Zealand works systematically to maintain a safe and healthy work environment and to develop
employees’ understanding of their own safety and that of their colleagues.
All Zealand employees are trained in the standard safety protocol, whereby they are given the tools to
manage their own occupational safety. Workplace audits (Arbejdspladsvurderinger, APV) are conducted
regularly.
A near accident reporting initiative to build on Zealand’s strong safety track record and safeguard against
potential future accidents is maintained.
All employees at Zealand have a job description and a CV, and these are reviewed on an annual basis.
Zealand is committed to developing its employees and providing continuous training. It therefore
allocates a fixed annual amount for every employee for training and development purposes. This policy
has proven to have synergistic benefits for both the Company and its employees. Zealand takes its
employee development interviews (EDI) very seriously, including clear goal and bonus goal setting,
competency development and performance evaluation on an annual basis.
Labor unions currently representing our employees include HK it, medie & Industri Hovedstaden. Zealand
negotiates a collective agreement in good faith every three years. The next negotiation is due in early
2017.
In addition, Zealand actively promotes an open, inclusive environment for its employees and has adopted
English as its primary language to accommodate it’s international employees. Zealand is also openminded and forward thinking in its employment development programs for Ph.D. candidates and trainees.
We have implemented various indicators to measure employee satisfaction. An annual employee
satisfaction survey is performed and measures the results of initiatives from the previous year as well as
identifying areas for improvement going forward.
Risk assessments are reviewed quarterly, and Zealand’s OHAS Committee conducts surveys on a
regular basis.

can create value for our stakeholders.

Ethics and quality in relation to research and development activities
Policy and guidelines
Zealand’s quality policy describes compliance with internationally recognized standards and guidelines
at all stages of research and development to ensure that we do not place patients or animals at risk due
to inadequate safety, quality or efficacy. Research applies Good Research Practice. Development
outsources GxP activities to qualified and approved vendors, but Zealand retains the sponsor
responsibilities. Oversight of the activities is carried out to ensure compliance with the requirements of,
for example, Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), Good Clinical
Practice (GCP) and Good Pharmacovigilance Practice (GVP).
Zealand’s Quality Management System (QMS) for research and development activities is described in
our Quality Manual. Our QMS is intended to be simple, agile and effective – based on a solid training
system. Learning from experience, we correct and make improvements to our processes and systems in
order to evolve our product Life Cycle Management (LCM) as we enter later development stages.
Achievements in 2016

Animal welfare
To allow for the discovery of new therapies and to ensure the efficacy and safety of new pharmaceuticals,
it is necessary to conduct in vivo experiments using laboratory animal species. Zealand’s policy on animal
ethics and welfare is to use animal studies only where no available and acceptable in vitro alternative
exists. All laboratory animals used under our responsibility must be treated humanely and with respect,
and only purpose-bred animals are used. Zealand adheres to the principles of the 3Rs (reduce, refine,
replace) and works to integrate these principles in all studies carried out, wherever possible.
All in-house animal studies are carried out in accordance with specific licenses issued by the Ministry of
Environment and Food of Denmark and international guidelines, as appropriate. Danish law stipulates
regular inspections of the animal facilities as well as comprehensive reporting protocols overseeing
experiments conducted during the year, processed through The Animal Experiments Inspectorate. The
upward flow of information and reporting, from lab technician to academic to head of department,
ultimately ensures the centralization of all the Company’s pharmacology and toxicology data, which are
duly recorded, organized and sent to the regulatory authorities.
All employees working with laboratory animals have appropriate and documented education and training.
Veterinary spot checks of our animal facilities are performed regularly.
In addition, Zealand’s internal ethical committee scrutinizes all proposed in-house in vivo pharmacology,
toxicology and PK experiments for compliance with regulatory and ethical permissions.
The necessity of animal experiments to Zealand’s research and development activities cannot be
overstated, and thus the Company constantly strives for the greatest vigilance and care in its treatment
of animals.
Achievements in 2016
•

In 2016, as in 2015, there were no reported incidents of negligence.

Focus areas in 2017
•

Zealand will continue to focus on animal welfare and comply with the principles of the 3Rs.

Environmental sustainability and climate
Policy and guidelines
Zealand’s environmental policy outlines our commitment to protect the environment. By conducting
business in a safe and environmentally friendly manner, we aim to reduce the impact on the environment
and climate as far as possible, taking into account our size and the type of company we are. However,
as we do not have any manufacturing, we consider our impact on the environment and climate as very
limited.
Zealand complies with laws and regulations relevant to our business.
We are mindful about the environment and climate and we encourage employees to act in an
environmentally friendly way, to produce as little waste as possible. We have implemented double-sided,
Zealand Pharma A/S Statutory report on Corporate Social Responsibility 2016

black and white printing as our office standard and we include a “please consider the environment before
printing” message in our standard e-mail signature.
We have procedures for recycling paper and cardboard as well as for the use of electricity and heating.
Zealand contributes to energy saving by selecting energy-efficient office and laboratory equipment
wherever possible.
Our travel guidelines limit unnecessary air travel by employees and encourage the use of our
videoconference facilities and teleconferencing as alternatives to business travel.
Achievements in 2016
•

Our efforts in 2016 has resulted in further strengthening the focus on environmentally and climate
friendly behavior at Zealand.

Focus areas in 2017

We are mindful about the environment and will continue to minimize our environmental impact
and encourage employees to continue with environmental and climate initiatives.

Business ethics
Policy and guidelines
Zealand’s quality and reputation as a business and scientific collaborator are of the utmost importance
to its strategic future. It is therefore in the best interests of the Company and of its stakeholders that
Zealand employees are trained and kept up to date with policies on corruption and compliance, insider
trading and appropriate and legal management of external intellectual property.
Zealand strives to operate according to the highest ethical standards and safeguards its business against
corruption and noncompliance where its employees are most at risk.
Zealand will proactively engage in a positive dialogue with all regulatory and advisory authorities and with
stakeholders from relevant industries in order to be inspired to make further improvements.
Zealand has an established whistleblower program, which is approved by the Danish Data Protection
Agency.

Anticorruption and compliance
Zealand actively promotes and maintains a policy of transparency and honesty with its employees.
Zealand’s Employee Handbook stipulates a set of policies, which specify the Company’s standards
regarding its employees’ general and legal conduct.
Insider trading
Zealand has taken every precaution to keep all its employees, board members and certain stakeholders
up to date and compliant with the Company’s internal rules. The Company distinguishes carefully
Zealand Pharma A/S Statutory report on Corporate Social Responsibility 2016

10/11

between those who are listed on its permanent insiders’ list and those who are exposed to what is
deemed insider information. In the latter case, Zealand takes every precaution to keep an up-to-date list
of employees’ knowledge of insider information. All new employees are introduced to our internal rules
and have to sign a document stipulating that they have read and understood these rules.
Intellectual property
The Company has strict policies regarding the proper use and transfer of intellectual property. Since it
was founded, Zealand has refined its confidentiality and material transfer agreements to reflect critical
changes in the industry, building on the extensive industry experience of many of its senior members.
Achievements in 2016
