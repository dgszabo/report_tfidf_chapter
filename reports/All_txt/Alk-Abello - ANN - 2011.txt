ALK’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

As an international company in the
pharmaceutical industry, ALK has an
important social responsibility. ALK
strives to live up to this responsibility and
be recognised by its stakeholders as a
reliable and responsible company characterised by professionalism, honesty
and integrity.
In 2011, ALK adopted a new CSR policy
and strategy. With the new CSR policy,
ALK aims to strengthen the company’s
CSR performance, while maintaining
focus on a few key areas. ALK’s social
responsibility is focused on four areas.

1. Prevention, diagnosis and
treatment of allergy
ALK is the world leader in allergy immunotherapy. ALK therefore has a particular
responsibility and is strongly committed
in its efforts to fight allergy. As from 2011,
a new aspect of the CSR policy is an initia-

tive whereby ALK makes its knowledge
and resources available to promote the
prevention, diagnosis and treatment of
allergy. ALK cooperates with all relevant
stakeholders to fight allergy, including
the public authorities and private and
public institutions, as well as NGOs. A
special focus area of ALK’s social commitment is children suffering from allergy,
including their risk of developing asthma.
In 2011, ALK sponsored the investigation
of respiratory allergy in Europe undertaken by the European Federation of
Allergy and Airways Diseases Patients’
Associations (EFA) via a questionnaire
survey of patient organisations in 18
European countries. The result has been
published in the book ‘Respiratory Allergies – Raise Awareness, Relieve the
Burden’, which documents the increase
in the prevalence of respiratory allergy,
as well as significant deficiencies and
inequalities in the prevention, diagnosis

and treatment of allergy in the European
countries.
Furthermore in 2011, ALK’s affiliates, in
cooperation with patient associations,
medical societies and authorities, have
undertaken activities to increase awareness of allergy and to make relevant information available to patients and their
relatives. For example, in cooperation
with the authorities in a Swedish region,
ALK has performed health economic
studies of allergy treatment to improve
treatment and provide the basis for a
decision on opening new allergy clinics
in the region. Together with two medical
societies in the allergy field, ALK in Spain
has developed and launched a patient
website with general information on the
prevention, diagnosis and treatment of
all types of allergy.
In 2012-13, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders in Denmark, ALK will
develop and test a number of activities

ALK’s policy for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
ALK’s social responsibility is focused on four areas. ALK supports the 10 principles in the areas of human rights, labour,
environment and anti-corruption that are part of the UN’s Global
Compact. The principles have been integrated in the company’s
ethical guide lines, the Code of Conduct.
The CSR policy covers all parts of ALK’s organisation, including
the company’s affiliates.
1. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of allergy
ALK has a particular responsibility and is strongly committed in
its efforts to fight allergy. ALK makes its knowledge and resources available to further the prevention, diagnosis and treatment
of allergy. A special focus area is children suffering from allergy,
including their risk of developing asthma.
ALK cooperates with all relevant stakeholders, for example
authorities, private and public institutions, and NGOs, to fight
allergy.

2. Production/environment
ALK has set ambitious targets for the reduction of the company’s
total energy consumption and its CO2 emissions.
3. Ethical conduct
All employees must observe ALK’s ethical guidelines, the Code
of Conduct. From mid 2012, all employees will have the opportunity for confidential reporting of serious offences through ALK’s
new whistleblower scheme.
4. Employees
ALK has a long tradition of working systematically to improve
the working environment and promote well-being at work.
ALK has set long-term goals for work-related absence, just as
competence development of the employees is a focus area. In
Denmark, ALK is health and safety certified.

to increase the focus on allergy – including, for example information to patients,
setting treatment goals, more cohesive
courses of treatment, and benchmarking treatment results. In 2014, this pilot
initiative will be evaluated with a view
to implementation in other countries via
ALK’s other affiliates.

The cooperation with EFA and the local

2. Production/environment
ALK works systematically to improve
working environment and environmental
conditions in every area of the company,
supported by the local SHE (Safety,
Health, Environment) organisations at all
production sites.
ALK has been environmentally certified
(ISO 14001) in Denmark since 2007,
while the other production sites (in Spain,
France, the USA and Canada) adhere to
the SHE standards. In 2011, the production facility in the Netherlands, which was
acquired in 2010, became integrated into
the Group’s SHE activities and will be part
of the company’s global SHE reporting
as of 2012. Also in 2011, the production
facilities in Spain were prepared for certification, which is expected to be achieved
in 2012.
In 2009, the Management adopted
global long-term goals for the SHErelated activities focusing on the reduction of energy consumption, including CO2
emissions. The objective is that absolute
energy consumption in 2014 will not have
increased compared to the consumption
in 20081 while CO2 emissions will have
decreased by at least 15%.
ALK has established a climate partnership agreement with DONG Energy with
the primary aim of reducing energy
consumption and thereafter reducing
1

the company’s individual CO2 emissions.
As part of the agreement, ALK will on
a continuous basis convert its energy
consumption in Denmark to CO2 neutral
energy.
The increase in ALK’s energy consumption was stopped in 2010. In 2011,
energy consumption was unchanged
compared with consumption in 2008,
after adjustment for the establishment
of new production sites, closure of old
production sites and acquisitions (cf. the
Global Greenhouse Gas Protocol).
CO2 emissions have decreased by 3% as
a consequence of greater use of renewable energy sources. As from 2013, a
larger decrease is expected, since the
ratio of renewable energy in Denmark will
increase as a consequence of the establishment of new wind turbines.
As in previous years, there were no complaints, and ALK complied with all legislative requirements in 2011, including environmental requirements. No unintended
spills occurred during the year.

3. Ethical conduct
In 2009, ALK established its ALK Code of
Conduct in order to support professionalism, honesty and integrity throughout the
company and in relation with customers, employees, shareholders, society,
suppliers and partners. All employees

are required to adhere to ALK’s Code of
Conduct.
In 2011, ALK decided to establish a
whistleblower scheme, ‘ALK Alertline’,
in order to give employees the opportunity for confidential reporting of serious
offences.
The scheme minimises the risk of illegalities and irregularities within the areas of
financial crime, environmental pollution
or inappropriate conduct, as well as
other circumstances that may be to the
detriment of ALK.
At the beginning of 2012, ALK applied to
the Danish Data Protection Agency for
permission to establish the scheme. This
permission is expected to be given in the
first half of 2012, after which the scheme
will be implemented.

4. Employees
ALK employs 1,781 employees, of whom
671 in Denmark. ALK wishes to continue
to be an attractive workplace that can
attract and retain the competent, wellfunctioning and committed employees
who are ALK’s most important resource.
ALK is therefore working systematically to
improve safety and the working environment, including the psychosocial working
environment, and to develop an organisation, culture and management that
encourage professional and personal
development.

Consumption and emissions in 2008 will be adjusted in terms of establishment of new production sites, closure of old production sites, acquisitions,
etc., in line with guidelines prepared in accordance with the principles of the Global Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

Safety
ALK in Denmark has been health and
safety certified (OHSAS 18001) since
2007. In 2009, Management adopted
global and long-term goals for the
improvement of safety and well-being at
work. The goal is to reduce the number
of absence days per employee due to
incidents at work on a continous basis.
In 2011, the number of absence days due
to work-related injuries fell to 0.062 days
per employee, which is a reduction by a
good 40% compared to the average for
the preceding three years.

Organisation, culture and
management
In 2011, ALK continued to work to
strengthen the performance culture.
Focus has been on the managers’
role, including the expectations held of
managers at each management level,
the development of managers’ ability to evaluate own employees and the
employees of other managers, and employee development. 75 managers were
trained during 2011, and in 2012 training
of managers will continue in the rest of
the organisation.

In 2011, as part of its optimisation of
global HR processes, ALK decided to
revise and integrate the employee survey
and manager evaluation into one single
survey that will take place every two
years, for the first time in spring 2013.
In addition, on an annual basis, ALK
reviews the organisation in order to
determine whether its strategic goals are
aligned with the resources available to
the various departments.
