Management commentary

Corporate Social Responsibility
The Group is still very active in protecting the environment and in addition Matas has
increased its focus on other relevant areas within CSR.
Matas' CSR efforts are described in detail on the Matas website under the front page icon
"Miljø & Etik". Matas is the only retail chain which on its own initiative collects and ensures
recycling of empty packaging of all goods purchased in the chain's stores. Furthermore,
Matas Miljøfond establishes green playgrounds at daycare centres.
