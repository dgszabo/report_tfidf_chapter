corporate social responsibility
Statement on corporate social responsibility
In accordance with Section 135 of the Executive Order on Financial Reports for Credit
Institutions and Investment Firms, etc., the following statutory statement on corporate
social responsibility has been prepared.

Corporate social responsibility policy
Ringkjøbing Landbobank’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) policy is based on the
bank’s long-standing roots in the local communities in which the bank is represented.
The bank has a desire to be a responsible and value-creating bank, and the bank works
to create the best results for its shareholders, customers and employees, the respective
local communities, the surrounding environment and finally the bank itself as a financial
institution.
It is also the bank’s goal to be seen as a solid and attentive partner among all its stakeholders.
The bank’s CSR policy is divided to focus specifically on the four stakeholder groups:
customers, employees, the environment and the local community. The bank’s CSR
policy is available on the bank’s website at the address: www.landbobanken.dk/csr, and
furthermore this complete statement is also published at the same internet address.
It is advised further to the bank’s CSR policy that the bank has not prepared a specific
human rights policy or a specific policy on climate. The bank supports the efforts to put
human rights and the climate high on the agenda, but as a local and regional bank, the
bank has not currently found it necessary to develop separate policies for this.
The statement below on the bank’s activities in 2015 is targeted towards the four stakeholder groups.

Customers
During the year, the bank continued its work on development of its advisory service and
products offered etc.
The work included:
•

Continued focus on the bank’s concept within the area of advice on pensions, where
the bank’s advisers give the customer a general view of pension saving schemes and
insurance cover in the event of disablement and death.

•

Providing advice on conversion of capital pensions and mortgage loans.

•

Implementation of a new user-friendly online bank solution for personal customers.

•

Continued focus on dissemination of the bank’s payment solution via mobile phone
and tablet - called "Swipp", for which an independent app was introduced during
the year.

•

Extension of the possibility for personal customers to sign documents electronically
and introduction of the same possibility for business customers.

•

Installation of cash machines which allow both withdrawals and deposits in Danish
kroner and euros.

Expectations concerning the advisory service, products offered etc. for 2016 include:
•

Continued development of the bank’s online and mobile banking solutions.

•

Further strengthening of the Private Banking advice, where the bank’s Private
Banking advisers provide specialised advice to customers with complex financial
situations.

•

Introduction of new consulting tools in connection with asset optimisation and
management.

•

Implementation of the possibility of holding web meetings with the bank’s customers.

Employees
The following was implemented in 2015 in relation to the bank’s employees:
• Performance reviews with all employees.
• Training and certification of advisers in financial products to ensure their provision of
competent advice on such products in accordance with applicable rules. The required recertification was also made, and new employees completed a training and
certification programme if they had not already done so on the date of employment.
• Continued training within advice on pensions.
• In-service training for a large number of employees in provision of all-inclusive advice.
• Employment of a total of 46 employees, including 12 new financial economists
and trainees. With a view to recruiting financial economists and trainees next year,
the bank held a Ringkjøbing Landbobank career day and visited the educational
institutions in the area in autumn 2015 to give the students in upper secondary
programmes in the bank’s local area information on a further education programme
with the bank, thus providing them with a basis on which to make a qualified career
choice. The bank also contributed as a partner to Educational Centre Ringkøbing
Skjern’s offer of economics and finance courses in relation to upper secondary programmes.
• Continued focus on the implementation of new routines and systems to increase the
efficiency of the bank’s administrative processes, which is a continuation of a previous in-house campaign to ensure employees a better overview of their own duties.
In the bank’s experience, this ensures happier employees, less stress and better provision of advice to the bank’s customers.
• Supported social activities in the bank, including financial support for the bank’s staff
association.
• Visit by a physiotherapist to the bank’s employees for a review of the individual
employee’s working posture etc.
• Election among the bank’s employees of employee representatives on the bank’s
board of directors.

• Loans for financing of wind turbines and solar cell plants.
• Financing of other energy-saving initiatives.
• Partnership with interactive web portal to help the bank’s customers to identify
energy-saving initiatives in their homes.

thus be signed electronically.
• Towards the end of the year it also became possible for the bank’s business customers to sign agreements and documents electronically.
• One of the bank’s branches held web meetings with customers as a trial.

• Continue to focus on:
• Optimisation of procedures and processes and conversion of procedures to electronic case handling.
• The energy saving workstation via previously implemented initiatives in the form
of bigger more energy-efficient monitors (lower power consumption and monitors switching to energy-saving mode when the user leaves the workstation), installation of two monitors at the workplace (which gives the staff the opportunity
to structure their work better on the monitors and helps to reduce the amount of
unnecessary printing), purchasing and use of power-saving printers, and finally
via a power-saving campaign (where as many electrical appliances as possible
apart from the computer monitors turn off automatically at the end of the working day).
• Use of the video conference equipment installed in the bank’s branches for video
conferences held internally in the bank, with the bank’s IT supplier Bankdata (to
reduce time and resources spent by the employees when travelling to Bankdata’s
departments in Silkeborg and Fredericia), for meetings with customers etc. The
bank saw an increase in the use of the video conference equipment during 2015.
• Car-sharing for and planning of training and meeting activities with physical attendance to reduce the associated travel as much as possible.
In all of the above initiatives, focus has been placed on reducing the bank’s environmental impact, including reduction of CO2 emissions, lower power and paper consumption
etc.
In 2016, the bank will continue to focus on reductions through the following initiatives:
• The bank will continue to finance renewable energy.
• Optimisation of procedures and processes.
• Training of the bank’s employees in holding web meetings and implementing web
meetings throughout the bank.
• Use of the installed video conference equipment for customer meetings, internal
meetings, meetings with business partners, internal training etc.
• Carrying out an energy audit comprising a screening of the bank’s properties and the
means of transportation used in the bank’s operations.
• When taking over and fitting up leased premises, the bank will ensure that they are
energy optimised.
