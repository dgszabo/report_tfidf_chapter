CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY POLICY

Corporate Social Responsibility Policy
Atlantic Petroleum‟s activities are undertaken with integrity, responsibility and respect for
the environment and the community in which these activities take place. This entails
conducting operations in an ethically and practically sound manner that minimises risks
and places high priority on the safety of those involved in Atlantic Petroleum‟s oil and gas
operations.
We are committed to comply with all applicable EHS (Environment, Health and Safety)
laws, regulations and standards and to apply responsible standards where legislation is
inadequate or does not exist. We monitor and review our CSR (Corporate Social
Responsibility) policy and procedures on a regular basis to ensure suitability and
effectiveness.
Atlantic Petroleum works to provide training, equipment and facilities necessary to
maintain a safe and healthy worksite and is additionally committed to a systematic
framework of hazard identification and risk assessment through which safe operations can
be managed. We will endeavour that all parties working on Atlantic Petroleum‟s behalf
recognise that they can impact our operation and reputation and that we all share a
common responsibility for our safety.
We place utmost attention and priority to protecting and minimising any harm to the
environment in our oil and gas activities, and continuously focus on improving our
environmental procedures, integrating responsibility throughout our activities.
