RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTAND SOCIAL CONDITIONSFor a number of years, RTX Telecom has worked systematicallyon maintaining satisfactory environmental and workingenvironmental conditions. The Group is constantly striving toobtain continuous improvements, also more than is requiredby the authorities.The Group’s activities include development and sale of advancedand high-technological wireless development projectsand products. In-house RTX Telecom only has a small physicalproduction as the majority of the Group’s production is outsourcedto cooperative partners in China and the Far East.Therefore, the Group’s impact on environment is, in all materialrespects, indirect, and in-house it is restricted to electricityand heating consumption as well as insignificant chemicalconsumption.The Group encourages its sub-suppliers to use environmentallyacceptable raw materials and products and to observe directivesgoverning the environmental production and handling ofelectronic equipment (the RoHS and WEEE directives).Finally, RTX Telecom requires the Group’s sub-suppliers to observeRTX Telecom’s code of ethics (Supplier Code of Conduct),which sets minimum requirements of the sub-suppliers’working conditions and environment, etc.
