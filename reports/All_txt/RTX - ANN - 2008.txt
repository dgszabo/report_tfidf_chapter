RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENT
AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS
For a number of years, RTX Telecom has worked systematically on maintaining satisfactory environmental and working
environmental conditions. The Group is constantly striving to
obtain continuous improvements, also more than is required
by the authorities.
The Group’s activities include development and sale of
advanced and high-technological wireless development
projects and products. In-house RTX Telecom only has a small
physical production as the majority of the Group’s production
is outsourced to cooperative partners in the Far East. Therefore, the Group’s impact on environment is in all materiality
indirect, and in-house it is restricted to electricity and heating
as well as insignificant chemical consumption.

The Group's activities comprise
development and sale of advanced and
high technological wireless development
solutions and wireless products.

The Group encourages its sub-suppliers to use environmentally
acceptable raw materials and products and to observe directives governing the environmental production and handling of
electronic equipment (the RoHS and WEEE directives).
