Overview and introduction
The ROCKWOOL Group has always been managed on the basis of values requiring
trustworthy and decent behaviour of the ROCKWOOL Group and its employees. Since an
update in 2010 in connection with the introduction of the new corporate strategy, Rock the
Globe, the values of honesty, entrepreneurship, efficiency, passion and responsibility have
been basic for actions taken in the Group and transactions with our stakeholders including
suppliers and customers.
These values – as interpreted by the ROCKWOOL Group - are further described on the
corporate website.
Conducting our business according to the corporate values is the adequate framework for
the ROCKWOOL Group to conform to modern standards for responsible and reliable
business conduct as well as corporate social responsibility.
The ROCKWOOL Group has a number of Policies and Manuals to help secure conformity.
All employees must conform to the conditions covering their employment in the
ROCKWOOL Group – including values and group policies.
On an overall level, the ROCKWOOL Group has for many years expressed its
commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the Group policy on social
responsibility and the Group’s social charter.
All employees and managers are required to ensure that these principles are being
followed.
The Group’s Principles of Leadership and procedures for bilateral conversations between
all managers and subordinates as well as regular, general evaluations of each employee
form the framework which helps ensuring that any misconduct according to these
principles are addressed and that corrective action is taken.
Furthermore, the ROCKWOOL Group has a whistleblower policy in order to ensure
continued ethical conduct of its business and in compliance with the law. The
whistleblower policy encourages reporting of serious breaches while ensuring the
protection of employees reporting such malpractice in the company. The reporting of any
such concerns and disclosures is done via an external law firm.

Special development 2013
In accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, art. 99 a., the company must
annually report on its progress within the area on CSR. In addition to the ROCKWOOL
Group’s general CSR policies and measures, this report covers - in each relevant section the special development and initiatives for the year 2013.

Code of Conduct for Suppliers updated
The ROCKWOOL Group’s updated Code of conduct for suppliers now specifies that the
ROCKWOOL Group must have access to all desired material and documentation from any
given supplier (e.g. payment agreements, contracts, environmental data etc.). For certain
areas – like e.g. child labour - the Code of Conduct for Suppliers has been made even
more clear and explicit in establishing non-acceptance. In general, the revised Code of
Conduct has a stronger emphasis on human rights and other CSR-related areas –
including stronger control with the supplier’s sub-suppliers.
New reporting tool to strengthen work place safety
It has been decided to implement a new system to report and investigate all common
types of incidents, near misses/hits and hazards in order to strengthen the level of work
place safety even further. The Group has a goal to reduce the frequency of accidents to
maximum two per million working hours by 2017.
Diversity goals defined (statement according to Danish Financial Statements Act 99 b)
Goals for increased diversity in the management teams have been defined. The
ROCKWOOL Group targets a 15-30% share of the under-represented gender in the
company’s management teams with a four year perspective. We have made good
progress in promoting internal mobility, increasing both cross-cultural and cross-functional
diversity. Focus on diversity will be strengthened through the company’s talent
management processes to support this goal.
Regarding diversity in the Board of Directors, a target of 0-1 female members elected by
the General Assembly is defined – also with a four year perspective. However, if a
possibility arises and a suitable candidate becomes available, a higher target may be
pursued.
By 31 December 2013, the actual diversity in the ROCKWOOL Group’s management
teams has been measured. It shows that throughout the international organisation an
average of 84% are male and 16% are female. Thus, we are within the range of the Group
target, however somehow in the low end which means that we will continue our effort in
increasing diversity.
Public advocacy
In 2013 the ROCKWOOL Group was a strong public advocate for the precautionary
approach within climate change. The Group strongly recommended the EU to set a 40%
CO2 reduction target for 2030 as compared to 1990 as the Group believes one of the most
cost efficient measures is to improve energy efficiency in buildings through insulation. In
2013, the Group’s largest subsidiary, Deutsche ROCKWOOL, joined “Stiftung 2 o”
(Foundation 2 degrees) in support of efforts to prevent global warming exceeding the two
degree centigrade tipping-point.
Increasing our positive net carbon footprint
By increasing sales according to our target of 8 per cent per annum and assuming a
constant product mix, the ROCKWOOL Group will nearly double the positive net carbon
impact of our products, from 4000 million tonnes of lifetime CO 2 savings from the

Page 4 of 34

5

insulation produced in 2009, to 7900 million tonnes in 2020. In 2013 the Group increased
sales by 1.6%, somewhat below the target. Estimated lifetime net carbon savings for
ROCKWOOL insulation produced in 2013 will be 5054 million tonnes. Read more about
our goals for increased CO2 efficiency in “Sustainability report – for the reporting year 2012”
and CDP report 2013 www.rockwool.com
Goal for improvement of energy and CO2 efficiency at ROCKWOOL factories
The ROCKWOOL Group has a goal for improving the energy efficiency and CO 2 efficiency
at our factories by 15% per tonne of produced ROCKWOOL stone wool in 2015 compared
to 2009. In 2013, special progress was made in order to make our melting process more
efficient and in introducing a new system to monitor and help reduce the consumption of
electricity. Furthermore, special assistance was given to our newcomer factories in Asia
and Russia to help them use ROCKWOOL know-how that can make the production
process more energy and CO2 efficient. More factories also got recycling equipment.
Recycling schemes for used stone wool strengthened
Apart from recycling more than 90% of our own production waste, more than a fourth of
the ROCKWOOL Group’s melt raw materials are recycled content, mostly received from
other industries. Most of our production companies are offering return schemes enabling
customers to return their ROCKWOOL product offcuts. In some locations residue stone
wool from refurbishments are also reclaimed and recycled. In 2013, the extended recycling
schemes recently introduced in Denmark (and the Netherlands (‘ROCKCYCLE’) were
further rolled out. They take back ROCKWOOL renovation and demolition waste from
building sites. Returned stone wool material is re-melted and turned into new insulation
products.

First-time reporting to Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
In order to facilitate transparency, in 2013 for the first time the ROCKWOOL Group’s
Sustainability Report was published according to the international standard for
sustainability reporting, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).

Top 5 climate reporter in Denmark
The CDP 2013 report of the ROCKWOOL Group was among the Top 5 climate reports in
Denmark.

Sourcing and Procurement organisation changed
The organisation of the ROCKWOOL Group’s Sourcing and Procurement (GSP) function
has been changed. This means that sourcing and procurement outside the already
globalized key suppliers is also in North America managed by GSP. GSP is now
responsible for sourcing and procurement in both Europe (incl. Russia) and North America

Page 5 of 34

6

meaning that all sourcing in these regions has to be made according to the policies
established in the ROCKWOOL Group’s Procurement Governance Manual. The
Procurement Governance Manual sets up clear policies for a number of areas to which all
procurement activities must be in compliance. There are for instance requirements to
documentation, transparency, environmental issues, legal compliance, human rights etc.
Compliance to this manual will be ensured by the ROCKWOOL Group’s internal auditing
function.
Furthermore, it has been decided that The Procurement Governance Manual in the future
should cover all sourcing and procurement in all countries. This will be implemented as
soon as possible.
Supplier evaluation and auditing procedure reviewed
During 2013, The ROCKWOOL Group’s sourcing and procurement function has continued
its implementation of a structured supplier evaluation process. In 2013, the process has
been further developed and it has been decided to expand the evaluation process to all
countries where the ROCKWOOL Group is active.
In addition to the 313 supplier evaluations (desk research) carried out in 2013, five
physical audits of suppliers were made.
In 2013, no suppliers were dismissed due to non-compliance with our Code of Conduct for
Suppliers or with laws and regulations, but a few suppliers have been put under
observation primarily in relation to environmental issues.
Business ethics policy updated
The Board of ROCKWOOL International has approved an update of the business ethics
policy. Among the changes are restrictions for the use of third parties. In connection with
this update, a central registration of gifts and hospitality over a certain threshold has been
introduced. Currently, this database and registration is in a trial phase but is expected to
be implemented throughout the company.
Anti-corruption now included in updated Risk Management System
The company’s annual risk evaluation process has been updated and further formalized.
The managing director and finance director of each operating unit submit their report to the
Group CFO and to the Group’s Senior Risk and Trademark Manager (appointed in 2013).
As a new element introduced in 2013, the contributing entities ensure that risks within their
areas of responsibility are described, scored for severity and likelihood, and quantified in
terms of actual financial impact. A Group Risk Management Report is then fed into the
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Follow-up on the report is done every quarter.
Renewed process for measuring employee engagement
A renewed process for measuring employee engagement and strengthening of corporate
culture has been introduced: RockPulse. It is now covering all affiliated ROCKWOOL
companies to conduct RockPulse surveys among the office staff employees annually.
Earlier we held a Global Employee Perception Survey (GEPS), on average every other
year. A pilot version is planned for Production workers with the intention to be included in
the same frequency.

Social responsibility
The ROCKWOOL Group will work in order to continuously improve our social performance
by setting high objectives and integrating social, human rights and health & safety
considerations into our daily business. The Group will maintain an open dialogue with our
stakeholders and report annually on our social performance.
The Group supports the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Group policy on social responsibility (appendix C) www.rockwool.com

Social Charter for the ROCKWOOL Group
In addition, the Group has chosen to further describe its social commitment in the Social
Charter for the ROCKWOOL Group.
Products and services sold by the ROCKWOOL Group improve the living conditions for
millions of people by giving them thermal comfort, affordable heating and cooling, reduced
fire risk, a lower noise and vibration level, and fewer chemicals in vegetables from
greenhouses. ROCKWOOL stone wool core insulation does not contribute to fire.
Furthermore, most of our products have a positive impact on the global problems of
climate change and diminishing reserves of fossil energy. These basic, positive
contributions to the world are important for the Group’s employees, for its management
and Board and for the spirit in which we all work.
The fact that the Group offers a positive contribution to the world is also paramount for the
Group’s largest shareholders, the ROCKWOOL Foundation and the Kähler Family.
According to its bylaws, the ROCKWOOL Foundation has to spend its entire earnings to
the benefit of society.
Of course the ROCKWOOL Group as a company has to make money in order to develop
the business and offer the shareholders a return on their capital. However, the priorities
should not only be set according to where the Group can make most money; it should also
be ensured that the Group continues to have a positive impact on society in the countries
and on the continents where it operates.
Therefore the Group should continue avoiding being involved in products and in operations
which may have a negative impact on people’s health and well-being, and we shall
conduct our business in a way that also ensures a positive social impact on our
surroundings. Conducting the business according to high ethical standards, and training

Page 7 of 34

personnel to a high international level, are typical ways in which the ROCKWOOL Group
positively influences our environment and society - wherever we operate.
The Group maintains an open dialogue with its stakeholders.

General evaluation and expectations for the future
The ROCKWOOL Group’s continuous work with CSR has resulted in several decisions
where the most acknowledged principles for CSR have been applied in connection with
the value based management of our business. Moreover we are confident that the
knowledge of the Group’s values and policies incorporating these principles is strong and
thus used as guidance in all work done in the ROCKWOOL Group. This is also reflected in
our communication with suppliers, customers and other stakeholders.
In the following the ROCKWOOL Group will elaborate on the translation of its Policies into
actions taken with regards to ten of the most widely acknowledged principles of sound
corporate social responsibility.
Relevant policies and sources are listed in connection with each principle. The detailed
contents of many additional policies are developed for internal use only and will not be
publicly available. Any requests about further information concerning the ROCKWOOL
Group’s policies can be directed to the Group Communication department (see

Environment
7. The company should support a precautionary approach to environmental
challenges.
Actions, systems and procedures
Due to the ROCKWOOL Group’s corporate mission and the nature of the
company’s main product area, insulation, the company is a major contributor to
energy efficiency and thereby reduction of CO2 emissions. The Group thus has a
significant positive net carbon impact by providing solutions addressing global
climate change. Positive environmental advantages such as e.g. noise reduction
and improved indoor climate are also provided by products from the company.
The ROCKWOOL Group has signed the ICC (International Chamber of Commerce)
Business Charter for Sustainable Development. The Group has thereby committed
itself to improve environmental management in accordance with the Charter’s 16
principles. In addition to adopting a precautionary approach, the commitment
includes having in place management practices to effect environmental
improvement, to measure performance and to report this performance openly to
internal and external stakeholders.
The ROCKWOOL Group has also drawn up a Group Environment Policy. It is
Group policy to either meet or exceed all relevant national and international
environmental standards and legislation.
The Group’s Environment Management System includes safety management and
auditing.
A number of detailed manuals including detailed standards, procedures, audit and
reporting requirements have been established for all relevant production processes.
A number of the ROCKWOOL Group’s production sites are certified according to
the ISO 14001and/or OHSAS 18001 standard for environmental management and
occupational health and safety.
ROCKWOOL companies have over the years won numerous environmental awards.
Major relevant product groups are subject to evaluation of their environmental
impacts based on a lifecycle assessment (LCA). LCA is a structured study of a
product’s positive and negative environmental impacts throughout its lifecycle: From
extraction of resources and raw materials through production to use and final
disposal of the product.
It is the ROCKWOOL Group’s policy to ensure the safe use of our products. Safety
aspects are assessed as part of the development process. A network of local
Product Health & Safety officers – under the leadership of the Vice President for

Page 21 of 34

22

Product Safety, Health & Ecology – is on hand to help our people guide our
customers in the safe use of ROCKWOOL Group products.
The Group is an active public advocate for energy efficiency and climate change
abatement and these Group public policy positions and our participation in public
policy development and lobbying on energy and CO2 efficiency are disclosed in our
CDP response.
The ROCKWOOL Group’s climate and environmental performance is published
annually in our Sustainability Report. The report covers areas like consumption of
energy and water; governance and community issues; as well as data on emissions,
waste and recycling etc. The report also presents an overview of the company’s
social and governance profile.
All employees and managers are required to ensure that these principles are being
followed.

8. The Company should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental
responsibility.
Actions, systems and procedures
Besides the comprehensive existing system for managing and auditing
environmental impacts, the ROCKWOOL Group is constantly developing
improvements of existing systems or new, relevant systems, programmes or
schemes which can help improve the company’s environmental performance or
promote a greater environmental responsibility.
Both the ICC Business Charter for Sustainable Development, the ROCKWOOL
Group’s own environmental policy as well as its social charter help us in our
commitment to promote greater environmental responsibility.
The Group is a part of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), publicly reporting
according to strict procedures and standards about the company’s CO 2 emissions.
The CDP reporting allows the company to benchmark itself against other relevant
players.
The ROCKWOOL Group has defined a general guideline for environmental
assessment of suppliers. This is used to screen existing and potential suppliers in
order to assure that also their environmental performance are taken into
consideration when evaluating the business relationship. This is seen as a tool to
extend The Group’s commitment to improve environmental performance also
outside the company itself.
All suppliers under contract with the Group Procurement function are asked to sign
a declaration to the Code of Conduct for Suppliers for the ROCKWOOL Group
including a commitment to comply with any relevant environmental legislation and in
general to act responsibly towards the environment.
All significant suppliers and contractors under contract with the Group Procurement
function are subject to random checks on environmental performance.

Actions, systems and procedures
According to UNEP, buildings use about 40% of global energy and they emit
approximately 1/3 of GHG emissions.
Diffusing best practise insulation technologies and building standards is crucial in
order to significantly reduce waste of energy and CO 2. Being the world’s second
largest producer of insulation material which in its lifetime saves many times the
CO2 emitted and the energy used for its manufacture and transportation, the
ROCKWOOL Group plays a significant role in the development and diffusion of
environmentally friendly technologies through our sales of insulating systems for
building, industrial and marine and offshore applications.
Given the energy and capital intensive nature of the ROCKWOOL production
process, all production sites and related procedures are assessed on efficiency and
environmental performance and best-practise experience is cross-fertilized across
the Group.
With regard to the company’s products, a significant amount of resources are
invested in research and development of new technologies that can improve the
energy efficiency in buildings and industrial processes globally. Apart from our own
efforts and competences engaged in this, the ROCKWOOL Group also works
together with a large number of external partners such as universities and other
institutions involved in research and development in this area.
The Group also plays an active role in informing and working together with
authorities, opinion leaders and political decision makers in order to promote the
best possible framework in terms of building codes etc. which will motivate towards
a higher level of energy efficiency in buildings.

Appendix B
Group Policy on business ethics

Guided by the ROCKWOOL Group values, our employees will build appropriate
relationships with our business partners and other stakeholders. Good own judgement will
always be required as not all situations can be covered by rules and guidelines. We seek
an appropriate balance between building, maintaining and expanding strong relationships
on the one hand whilst ensuring that our professionalism is maintained and our integrity
not impaired / jeopardized on the other hand.
The following general principles for conduct in our relationships with business partners and
other stakeholders are to be followed:


We trust our employees to make sound judgements.



When in doubt, employees will seek guidance and confirm with their manager.



Any behaviour to be avoided that might pose a (perceived) threat to the independence
of ourselves as well as of the business partner.



In case a business partner has a business ethics policy which is more stringent than
ours, we will comply with his/her requirements.



We consider “reasonable activities” to be those that are not viewed as excessive by a
rational and informed third party taking into consideration that we operate a global
company.



We comply with laws, regulations and standards that apply to us in our professional
conduct.

Of particular interest to the area of business ethics, the importance of compliance with the
following Group policies is noted:


Business Responsibility



Risk Management



Corporate Social Responsibility

Appendix D:
Code of Conduct for Suppliers to the ROCKWOOL Group
The ROCKWOOL Group is committed to running its business on ethically and
environmentally-sound principles. The ROCKWOOL Group wishes to ensure that we act
responsibly in accordance with ethical, legal and international standards of behaviour and
we endeavour to continuously improve our social performance.
The ROCKWOOL Group supports the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and the ten universal principles defined in the UN Global Compact relating to
human rights, labour environment and anti-corruption.
The ROCKWOOL Group expects suppliers to uphold similar standards, ideally described
in a CSR policy. This Code is designed to explain our expectations to our suppliers in
more detail.
Compliance with Applicable Laws and Standards
The ROCKWOOL Group expects suppliers to comply with all international, national and
local laws and standards relating to employment, environmental, purchasing and
manufacturing practises.
Employment Practices
The ROCKWOOL Group wishes to ensure that the working practices of our suppliers
towards their employees regarding such issues as equal opportunities, Trade Union
recognition and fair employment terms comply with or exceed national and internationally
accepted standards. The ROCKWOOL Group expects all suppliers to strive towards
reducing any potential risk to their employees and to provide them with safe and healthy
working conditions.
No supplier must, under any circumstances, be involved in the use of child labour.
Environmental Practices
The ROCKWOOL Group expects suppliers to comply with the environmental standards
and regulations relevant to their business and to practice sound environmental principles
in their operations.
The ROCKWOOL Group has adopted the ICC “Business Charter for Sustainable
Development – Principles for Environmental Management”, which identifies
responsibilities, requires an Environmental Officer to be appointed, expects companies to
have an Environmental Management System with specific 3 year plans and expects all
new machinery to be environmentally risk assessed before coming into operation. The
ROCKWOOL Group encourages suppliers to follow these principles.

Supply Chain Practices
The ROCKWOOL Group expects suppliers to enforce these guidelines towards their
suppliers. ROCKWOOL also reserves the right to audit any sub-supplier.
Purchasing Ethics
Employees of the ROCKWOOL Group, irrespective of their position in the organisation, will
not accept any gift from any supplier (either directly or indirectly) that could appear to
influence their decisions on sourcing and contracting issues.
The ROCKWOOL Group expects suppliers to ensure that employees, sub-suppliers and
sub-contractors are not only aware of these guidelines, but are also committed to uphold
the principles set out above.
Bribery
Bribery is defined as occurring when a person offers, gives or promises, directly or
indirectly, any financial or other advantage to a private (e.g. business partner) or public
industry (e.g. Public Official) in exchange for improperly performing a relevant function or
activity. In addition, not only the act of bribing but also the act of being bribed is
unacceptable defined as a person requesting, accepting or agreeing to accept a financial
or other advantage, in exchange for improperly performing such a function or activity. The
ROCKWOOL Group finds bribery unacceptable and expects suppliers to officially and
explicitly take a stand against bribery.
Compliance
Compliance with these guidelines is seen as the basis of a good, constructive and
professional working relationship between companies. Any deviation from these guidelines
could detrimentally affect this relationship and the ROCKWOOL Group reserves the right
to cancel the contract in case of any violation of this Code of Conduct.
Signature
By signing this Code of Conduct, we agree to abide by this Code of Conduct. We further
agree that the ROCKWOOL Group is entitled to carry out audits with full access to all
information, e.g. collective agreements, minutes of meetings with workforce
representatives, supplier information etc.
