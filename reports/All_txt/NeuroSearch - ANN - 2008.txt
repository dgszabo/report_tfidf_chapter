ENVIRONMENTAL
IMPACT AND ETHICS
ENVIRONMENT
NeuroSearch does not currently issue
separate environmental reports because
its activities only have a limited impact
on the environment. NeuroSearch is
aware of its potential external environmental impact and therefore continuously
evaluates how various environmental
factors can be improved with respect to
preventing, reducing or remedying damage to the environment.
The external environment
The company does not yet have any
actual industrial production, so its
discharge into the air, soil and water
is exceedingly limited.

In recent years, NeuroSearch has focused
on reducing its consumption of power
and water. In 2008, we expanded the head
office in Ballerup by 819 square meters of
space, including 32 new office workplaces.
The latest technologies were used to
achieve energy-conscious solutions and
control for lighting and heating. In addition, a completely new environmental yard
of about 450 square meters has been added which meets all demands with respect
to safety and correct handling of all types
of waste handled. In spite of this addition
and the increase in the number of staff,
our power consumption declined with 3%
compared to the 2007 level. Consumption
of water was on a level with 2007.
NeuroSearch uses natural gas to heat the
head office in Ballerup. The gas consumption in 2008 increase by almost 2% year
on year without degree-day adjustment.
At Gothenburg, a district heating system
is used in which large amounts of waste
heat from industrial or other processes

“We currently have a good
working environment at
NeuroSearch which it is
my goal to maintain and
develop so that our company appears as a modern
and attractive place of
employment”

is re-circulated into a network of heatpipes running through the city.
NeuroSearch uses small quantities of
radioactive trace elements in certain
laboratory experiments. This radioactive
material is stored and disposed of in
compliance with the guidelines and instructions issued by the Danish National
Institute of Radiation Protection.
The indoor environment
We have a good working environment at
NeuroSearch which we want to maintain
and develop. There is always room for
improvement, so we will constantly work
to ensure that NeuroSearch will continue
to be a safe and healthy workplace, in
terms of both the psychological and
physical working environment.
NeuroSearch has always focused on
working environment activities, and in
2008 we decided to establish a dedicated
working environment department.
In the years ahead, working environment
activities at NeuroSearch will be more
structured and uniform in the organisation, and we will work towards achieving
a working environment certification level.
This will lead to efficiency improvements
in our working environment activities,
including documentation, while also
ensuring that we can continue to work in
the optimum manner in our day-to-day
activities taking into account employee
safety and health.

Annual Report 2008

NeuroSearch complies
with all regulatory
requirements with
respect to animal
experiments, ensuring
that they are performed
in the most humane and
appropriate manner

ETHICS
The regulatory authorities require that
all new drugs are subject to extensive
and lengthy studies before they can be
marketed. These studies include testing
in animals and clinical trials in healthy
humans and in patients. Another reason
why these animal experiments are necessary is the need to understand disease
mechanisms and the safety of potential
new drugs before they are administered
to humans. NeuroSearch is in a close
dialogue with the authorities on how to
reduce the number of experiments and
how to improve experiments conducted.
NeuroSearch also follows the regulatory
rules closely with respect to storing of
laboratory animals. The latest initiatives
include “environmental enrichment”,
which includes the layout of cages so that
the animals can build nests, clean themselves and have other natural behaviour.
External contract research organisations
are carefully selected when safety experiments are to be made in animals before
clinical studies are conducted with the
company’s drug candidates. NeuroSearch
only uses European organisations of good
international repute that comply with all
European standards on animal welfare
and receive relevant inspections by the
authorities.
As a relatively new initiative, NeuroSearch
has begun to use zebra fish as test organisms. For instance, it is possible to induce a condition in the larva of zebra fish
which is similar to epileptic seizures, and
if a drug compound is added to the water,
it is possible to measure whether the
compound inhibits the seizures and could
thus be a new anti-epileptic drug. So far,
zebra fish have only replaced a small
part of the other laboratory animals that
are normally used, but it is possible that
they can also be used as models for other
diseases in future. In this respect, the
genes of the fish can be mutated so that
they can be used as a model for disorders
such as Alzheimer ’s disease.

In fact, using larva from zebra fish instead
of rodents has great ethical and economic benefits. The regulatory authorities,
especially the US health authorities (the
FDA) have shown interest in this new type
of laboratory animals. Zebra fish could
potentially be accepted as animal models
for testing of new pharmaceuticals within
a few years, which could considerably
reduce the number of other laboratory
animals used.
NeuroSearch aims to respect a number
of formulated international principles.
These principles concern:
