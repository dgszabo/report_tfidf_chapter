Report on CSR and gender
composition
NeuroSearch’s Board of Directors consists of two male
members and one female member, so the Company
maintains an equal gender distribution at the supreme
management level. There is an equal gender
distribution at the other management levels, and the
Company consequently does not define policies in this
respect.

In view of its size and current activities, NeuroSearch
no longer has:
A policy for corporate social responsibility
A policy for respecting human rights
A policy for reducing the climate impact from
the Company's activities

Working environment
The physical working environment has been simplified
in step with the reduction of activities in NeuroSearch.
The Company’s office is located in an office partnership
from where the remaining administration is handled.
