ENVIRONMENT
H+H does not at present prepare any separate environmentalreports, as the environmental impact of its production is limited.However, H+H is committed to actively tackling the environmentalissues related to its operations, including ways of avoiding,containing or remedying any adverse environmental impacts.Aircrete is based on water, sand or pulverised fuel ash, lime,cement and aluminium. The production of aircrete thus does notinclude any scarce natural resources. To save water resources,some of H+H’s factories collect rainwater for use in production,and production water is reused to some extent.The machinery used for manufacturing aircrete is electricallypowered, and gas is used for raising steam for autoclaving theaircrete. H+H continuously strives to minimise its consumption ofelectricity and gas in order to reduce its CO2 emissions and productioncosts, and H+H regularly evaluates the possibility ofreplacing all or part of its electricity and gas consumption withalternative, more sustainable energy sources.Aircrete can be reused in crushed form for applications such asroad fill, insulation material and material for lightweight aggregateconcrete.KNOWLEDGE SHARING AND BEST PRACTICEThe H+H Group has a flat organisational structure with a smallcentralised management in the parent company H+H InternationalA/S. Intragroup communication is therefore straightforwardand efficient, involving very few links.The various national companies in H+H regularly exchange experienceand engage in intragroup benchmarking. Initiatives includethe establishment of projects with participation by relevant employeesfrom the national companies involved. One example ofproject aims is the development of best practices for productionprocesses, products, logistics, sales and marketing, etc.
