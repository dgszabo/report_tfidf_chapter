Improving quality of life for a sustainable world
ALK is a global pharmaceutical company with a mission to
improve quality of life for people with severe respiratory
allergies. With a near-century long heritage of pioneer
research and product innovation in the treatment of allergic
disease, today ALK’s business is focused on the prevention,
diagnosis and treatment of the respiratory diseases
allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma. ALK is a world leader in
allergy immunotherapy (AIT), a unique, disease-modifying
treatment that addresses the underlying cause of allergy.
The treatment induces a protective immune response that
provides sustained symptom relief and potentially reduces
patients’ risk of developing other allergies as well as asthma.

The business model relies on innovation. ALK works
continuously to increase the quality, safety and efficacy of its
products and to introduce new, more convenient treatments
that can improve access to treatment and facilitate market
expansion. During the past 15 years, more than 17,000
patients have participated in clinical trials for a portfolio
of new products that targets the most common global
respiratory allergies.

ALK’s business model is based on an unrivalled
understanding of allergens and how they affect the human
body, as well as the link between allergy and respiratory
diseases such as asthma. This understanding enables
ALK to develop and produce its biological medicines using
complex manufacturing processes that are subject to
comprehensive analyses and quality control at all stages.
This knowledge is key to protecting ALK’s market position
against new competitors.

In addition, ALK partners with other companies to launch
its latest products beyond Europe and North America.
In cooperation with ALK, these partners handle clinical
development and registration for their markets, as well
as marketing and sales. Meanwhile, ALK handles product
supply, ensuring compliance with the relevant quality and
manufacturing regulations. Depending on the terms of the
partnership, ALK then receives a share of the income from
product sales.

The company has its own commercial infrastructure in
20 countries and distributors in a large number of other
markets.

ALK employs approximately 2,300 people in R&D, Product
Supply, Commercial Operations and Administration,
primarily in Europe and North America.
As a pharmaceutical company and an international player, it
is our obligation and intention to continue improving quality
of life for people with allergy.
The planning and execution of our CSR efforts is based on
the UN Global Compact scheme. With the UN Sustainable
Development Goals, we have gained a unique opportunity
to actively contribute to the development of inclusive and
sustainable societies. With our presence in countries across
the world we are in a good position to help realising the
goals through our products and services, our willingness
to continuously looking for cleaner and more efficient
production processes, but also by opening our doors to
a healthy and safe workplace with diversity and equal
opportunities for all.

The Global EHS (Environment, Health and
Safety) Policy ensures that the focus on
environmental protection is incorporated
into our daily activities.

approach to environmental and climate
challenges, undertake initiatives to promote
greater responsibility and encourage the
development and diffusion of environmental
and climate friendly technologies.

We strive to:

We provide open and honest information on
our policy, efforts and results.

•	 Involve and commit our employees to
participate in the daily environmental
work

The Global EHS policy is part of a Global EHS
Management System and all production
sites¹ adhere to the system.

•	 Educate our employees and implement
preventive actions to ensure that factors,
which present environmental risks, are
monitored and constantly reduced
•	 Ensure that environmental issues are
proactively integrated into planning and
design
•	 Measure the results of our efforts and set
new goals for continuous improvements,
particularly within the areas of energy
consumption, CO2 emission and water
usage

 Action
ALK has continued the systematic approach
to reduce environmental and climate impact
supported by the local EHS organisations at
all production sites.
In 2016 we strengthened our focus on
energy savings. We thus:
•	 Identified energy saving projects in
Madrid and Hørsholm through energy
audits

We act in compliance with legal and other
requirements and where relevant, we are
involved in changes of these.

•	 Implemented energy saving projects,
including the replacement of 2,600 bulbs
by LED lightning in Post Falls

Our efforts in this area are guided by
principles 7, 8 and 9 of the Global Compact
which help us to support a precautionary

•	 Supported renewable energy production
by buying electricity from windmills at
Sprogø, Denmark

¹	 Hørsholm, Madrid, Vandeuil, Varennes, Port Washington, Post Falls and Spring Mills

ALK  Sustainability report 2016

 Risks
As part of the EHS Management System,
initial screenings for environmental and
climatic risks were carried out in 2005. Back
then, we identified significant risk factors
that still remain risk factors today; energy
consumption, CO2 emissions and water
usage.
The handling of chemicals involves a
potential risk of spills to the ground or waste
water systems.
All activities are closely monitored and have
led to no unintended releases or spills in
2016.

 Target
•	 We implement preventive actions,
monitor and constantly reduce risks,
measure the results of our effort and set
new goals for continuous improvements
•	 We seek to reduce energy consumption,
CO2 emission and water usage
•	 By 2030, ALK substantially reduces
waste generation through prevention,
reduction, recycling and reuse

4

 Planned activities in 2017
and expected results
In 2017 we will initiate a mapping of our
packaging materials in order to identify
new ways of reducing and/or use recycled
materials.
We will implement energy saving initiatives
and screen for water saving initiatives to be
implemented.

	

 Results
All production sites report data quarterly
which is evaluated and reported by the
Global EHS Manager.
Consumption is measured on the basis of
three KPIs forming part of the long-term EHS
goals 2015-2018, and approved by Board of
Management in 2015:

Energy: By the end of 2018,
the energy consumption must
not exceed the consumption
in 2014
The energy consumption has decreased
by 1% comparing 2016 with baseline year
2014. The good result is considered fragile
and we must keep focusing on saving
initiatives.

CO2: By the end of 2018,
the CO2 emission must be 5%
less compared to the emission
in 2014

corruption in all its forms, including
extortion and bribery.

6

	

 Policy
We work against corruption in all its forms,
including extortion and bribery. Thus,
we do not accept bribery in connection
with our business activities, regardless of
these activities being carried out by our
employees or through a third party.
Support of the anti-corruption commitment
is an integrated part of our business partner
handling process and we continue our
focus on safeguarding that our business
partners acknowledge and respect their
responsibility when doing business with ALK.
Our commitment is expressed in ALK’s Code
of Conduct and pursues the goals laid down
in UN Global Compact Principle 10.

 Action
In 2016, our commitment to anti-corruption
is manifested further by corporate
procedures for our interactions with
healthcare professionals together with our
procedures for authorisation and signing
of contracts and purchases. We enter into
agreements and make purchases in a
transparent and responsible manner.

Our whistleblower hotline, the ALK Alertline,
provides our employees with an opportunity
to report illegal or other serious concerns
with respect to ethical behavior in a secure
and confidential manner.
The ALK Code of Conduct was integrated
in our HR-system Workday, prompting all
employees globally to read and sign off the
Code of Conduct once a year.

 Results
Our results in 2016 are measured on the
basis of two KPIs.
•	 Number of reports received through our
whistleblower hotline, the ALK Alertline
No incidents of corruption and bribery or
direct political contributions have been
reported via the ALK Alertline in 2016.
•	 Percentage of employees with seniority
> 3 months who have read the ALK Code
of Conduct
98% of employees throughout the
organisation have reported reading the ALK
Code of Conduct.

ALK  Sustainability report 2016

 Risks
The main risks related to our activities
include employees’ and business partners’
violation of our anti-corruption commitment
and potential legal and financial
consequences thereof.
Mechanisms for mitigating and preventing
corruption and bribery include:
•	 An annual assessment of the risks in
relation to our industry and the countries
in which we operate via the ALK Risk
Committee
•	 Implementation of corporate procedures
for our interactions with healthcare
professionals together with our
procedures for authorisation and signing
of contracts and purchases
•	 Relevant external commercial partners
are vetted concerning corruption
Ad hoc screenings and assessments in
relation to anti-corruption are documented
and if needed, ad hoc mitigation plans are
developed.

7

 Target
•	 ALK eliminates corruption and bribery in
all their forms throughout our value chain
•	 We do not contribute directly to political
contributions of any kind

 Planned activities in 2017
and expected results
With the purpose of promoting anticorruption practices in ALK, we will provide
our employees with supplementary
information on anti-corruption and test it. In
2017 all employees with more than 3 months
seniority in ALK must pass an anti-corruption
test.
A procurement initiative with the purpose
of promoting anti-corruption in our supply
chain will introduce specific clauses on anticorruption in supplier agreements going
forward.

Human Rights
ALK’s social responsibility embraces a commitment to respect human rights. We are especially dedicated to promoting the
Sustainable Development Goal to good health and well-being, and believe our products and effort to ensure occupational health have
a positive impact on the right to health of patients and our employees.

The Sustainable Development
Goal 3 forms the basis for our
commitment to promote good
health and well-being

Good health and well-being
ALK contributes to healthy lives and promotes wellbeing for patients and our employees at all ages.

8

	

 Policy
ALK is committed to contribute to healthy
lives and well-being through prevention,
diagnosis and treatment of the respiratory
diseases allergic rhinitis and allergic
asthma.
Together with a strong focus on occupational
health and well-being in our work place, this
helps us contribute to the human right to
enjoyment of the highest attainable health.
Our Global EHS (Environment, Health and
Safety) Policy ensures that the focus on
occupational health is incorporated into our
daily activities.
As part of the EHS Policy we:
•	 Educate our employees and implement
preventive actions to ensure that
factors, which present health risks, are
monitored and constantly reduced

•	 Ensure that occupational health issues
are proactively integrated in planning
and design
•	 Measure the results of our efforts and set
new goals for continuous improvements
In a digital age, the protection of personal
data of our employees, patients and
customers contributes to the feeling of wellbeing. Our contribution to the right to privacy
and data protection lies in the integration of
effective data protection measures in ALK
procedures and daily practices.
All activities to promote health and wellbeing are carried out in compliance with
legislation and our efforts in this area pursue
the overall goals in UN Global Compact
Principles 1 and 2 on supporting and
protecting human rights and avoiding being
complicit in human rights abuses.

ALK  Sustainability report 2016

 Action
Good health and well-being
Good ergonomics have been a focus area at
all production sites and actions have been
taken to improve the daily life. In Post Falls,
Varennes and Hørsholm ergonomic experts
have been hired to help.
In order to promote good health and wellbeing, ALK in Denmark has implemented
an Alcohol and Drugs Policy. The policy
describes how ALK strives to actively
support and help employees who are
alcohol or drug dependent to seek guidance
and treatment with a view to retaining the
employee in the job.
In Hørsholm, a health program is available
for all employees (Sundhedsordning).
About 40 members of the local EHS
organisation in Hørsholm have joined a twoday seminar focusing on how to maintain a
good psychological working environment
and learn more about stress. Members
of the EHS organisation are key players in
preserving a good behavior culture.

Privacy and Data protection
In order to prepare for the implementation
of the EU General Data Protection Regulation
in 2018, to inform and advice Board of
Management on data protection measures,
and to initiate training and awareness
raising, a position as Data Protection
Manager was established in 2016.

 Risks
Workplace related health risks in ALK
include the potential risk of exposure to
concentrated allergens for employees
handling allergens (raw material). Exposure
may result in an acute allergic reaction or
development of allergy. Similarly, working
with chemicals represent a potential health
risk.
Activities in health risk areas are closely
monitored and we run allergy testing
where it’s possible, training programs and
information campaigns on risk issues for all
employees.
In all countries, where we operate, we
comply with national legislation.

	

 Target
•	 ALK helps creating access to safe,
effective, quality and affordable
essential medicines and vaccines for all
patients with respiratory allergies
•	 ALK ensures occupational health and
access to health care services in the work
place for all employees

 Planned activities in 2017
and expected results
As part of the EHS program, we will
continue to improve the ergonomic working
conditions for employees in all positions and
develop EHS training.
A data protection review will be carried
out and steps taken to ensure adequate
organisational, technical and security
measures to meet the requirement for
effective data protection. This will also
include general awareness raising.

Labour Rights
ALK supports the Sustainable Development Goal to promote decent work and economic growth. As part of this effort we are
committed to ensure safe working conditions, fair employment and access to training and education for all employees.

The Sustainable
Development Goal
8 forms the basis
for our commitment
to promote safe
working conditions,
fair employment and
development of our
employees

Decent work and
economic growth
ALK works systematically to
improve the working environment
in all parts of our organisation and
promote safety at work. We want to
be an attractive work place for all.

11

	

 Policy
The purpose of ALK’s HR Policy is to support
short and long term goals and to create a
working environment which appeals to all
employees at ALK, so that we can attract,
develop and retain well-qualified and
engaged employees.
As part of this effort, we will continue our
efforts and commitment towards equal
opportunities for women and men at all
management levels.
Our commitment to a safe and attractive
workplace is reflected in the following focus
areas:
•	 Fair wages by means of compensation
policy and alignment with the level at
local pharmaceutical companies
•	 The well-being of employees and their
families by means of local initiatives,
practices and procedures in keeping with
local traditions, conditions and needs
•	 Proactive integration of safety aspects in
planning and design
We act in compliance with national
legislation in the countries in which we
operate and along the lines of UN Global
Compact Principle 3-6.

 Action
Engagement
Following the Engagement Survey 2015,
ALK introduced a follow-up survey
opportunity and action plans for all teams.
For teams with low engagement scores,
it was mandatory to create and complete
action plans. For the rest of the teams, it
was optional. A total of 25% of all teams,
covering more than 33% of the organisation,
engaged by option in the follow-up survey in
the spring of 2016.
Women in management
When conducting the yearly Organisational
Review, ALK had an increased focus on
monitoring the share of women at all
management levels.
ALK aims to maintain levels of remuneration
that are competitive in terms of market
levels for comparable jobs, especially in the
bio-pharmaceutical industry. In 2016, we
have implemented a global compensation
strategy which entails evaluation of all
positions at ALK cross-country and crossfunctionally, establishing salary bands
based on local benchmarks, and thereby
initiating fair and transparent compensation
for everyone across ALK.
Safety
The Board of Management reviewed
the long-term EHS goals and decided to
strengthen the safety target (number of
accidents with absence per million working
hours) from 4.0 to 3.0, and at the same time
include all ALK locations. Previously, only

ALK  Sustainability report 2016

work-related accidents from production
sites were monitored.

•	 We have a strong focus on the well-being
and engagement of all ALK employees

Child labour
ALK has taken steps in 2016 to strengthen
our contribution to the effective abolition of
child labour. Our effort is concentrated on
suppliers in countries where child labour
constitutes a high risk.

•	 ALK takes immediate and effective
measures to eradicate child labour and
forced labour by 2025 end child labour in
all forms

 Risks
ALK has identified specific countries and
employee groups which are below salary
benchmark. ALK has looked further into this
and has allocated extra resources to raise
the salaries.
Regarding safety, ALK is in general not
a high-risk company. However, we will
enhance the general safety awareness in all
parts of the organisation.
Most suppliers are located in Western
countries, Japan and Australia and are as
such not presenting a high risk within safety,
education and child labour. General labour
rights, including fair wages, decent and safe
working conditions, and child labour do,
however, represent a risk area of particular
attention in interaction with suppliers and
their sub-suppliers in non-western countries.

 Target
•	 ALK promotes safe and secure working
environments for all employees

 Results
Two EHS KPIs on well-being and safety are
part of the long-term EHS goals 2014-2018,
approved by the Board of Management
primo 2015 and reviewed ultimo 2016. They
are supplemented with indicators on labour
rights.
Well-being at work
•	 Obtain the score ≥75 on the action area
“Daily Work” in the Engagement Survey

Women in management
In 2013, the Board of Directors defined a
target to increase the proportion of women
among shareholder-elected board members
to one or two by 2018. The number of female
shareholder-elected members in the Board
of Directors is one, corresponding to 17%, in
accordance with the overall target of one or
two members by 2018. Included employeeelected members, female members
constitute 22% of the Board of Directors.

	

In 2016 no full Engagement Survey has
been performed and therefore no result is
available. The next Engagement Survey will
be carried out in 2017.
No incidents of discrimination has been
reported to the ALK Alertline.

 Planned activities in 2017
and expected results

•	 Total number and rates of new employee
hires and employee turnover by age
group, gender, and region

•	 Number of work-related accidents with
absence

•	 Local residents are employed, including
for management positions. Training and
career opportunities are offered to local
residents

In 2016 the number of injuries with absence
per million working hours was 4.4 including
all ALK locations. Altogether 16 accidents
occurred. The results is not satisfactory
and a strong focus and effort will be put into
preventive actions.
4.4 % of the total workforce at production
sites are represented in joint managementworker health and safety committees.
Child labour

ALK encourages and engages in good
relations with the local community in
which we are based, by means of active
participation in social and business-related
activities.
During 2016, we cooperated with local
communities on educational visits by
local high school children. In Denmark,
we strengthened our relationship with
Copenhagen University by means of
participation in the annual Company Day
for pharmacy students and sponsored
the Olympic Games for School Children in
Copenhagen, linking an active lifestyle to
improved health and well-being.
At our headquarters in Hørsholm we
welcomed a new employee with refugee
background from Syria in an internship to
help him integrate into the Danish society.
