Corporate Social
Responsibility
We want to make a positive
difference for our consumers
and to create value for our
stakeholders. In order to do
that, we must apply clear
principles and strategies
to the management of our
business. Consumers in all
our markets must be able to
rely on our products being
of a very high quality and
produced under safe conditions.
At the same time, we must
continuously seek to reduce
our environmental impact and
contribute positively to the
overall development of society.
A statement is made in accordance with
section 99A of the Danish Financial
Statements Act.
Our corporate social responsibility work
is an integrated part of Royal Unibrew’s
business approach, and our eﬀorts in this
area are based on our values and the ten
principles of the United Nations Global
Compact in respect of human rights,

“Royal Unibrew’s Code of Ethics” is the
Management’s guidance to all group
employees on ethical issues, including
targets and guidelines for the enforceν
ment of human rights within the Group
and with business partners. “Royal

safety, job satisfaction and eﬃciency.
The preventive measures at the brewerν
ies in 2014 included the following:
Denmark
σ All operators and salaried employees
at the Danish breweries participated in
a comprehensive training programme
on behavioural safety. Moreover, a
group of employees were trained as
”ambassadors” with responsibility for
unfolding the health & safety dialogue
in the organisation.
σ All safety groups participated in a joint
health & safety day.
σ A workplace assessment was carried
out among all employees in Denmark,
and based on this action plans are beν
ing prepared.
Lithuania
σ In Lithuania working conditions at the
distribution warehouses were considν
erably improved. Manual palletisation
was replaced by automated solutions;
palletisation and order picking are
now carried out far more eﬃciently
and safely than previously by means of
safe and ergonomic lifting equipment.
Finland
σ Hartwall’s alcohol awareness policy
as well as equal opportunity guideν
lines were updated and implemented.
It was decided that in the period
December 2014 to April 2015 Hartwall

working capacity.
σ Within supply chain Hartwall continuν
ously makes use of preventive safety
observations with a view to observν
ing, discussing and supporting safe
behaviour. At Hartwall the key health
& safety ratios are above industry
average, and absence due to sickness
continues to decline.
These measures combined have resulted
in a reduction of the total number of
occupational accidents by more than half
in 2014, and the number is now at the
lowest level in five years.

Selected targets for 2015
σ It remains the target to reduce the
number of occupational accidents
to zero and to continue the focused
safety eﬀorts.
σ In Denmark all employees at the Albani
brewery as well as distribution workers
must participate in a course on behavν

must be profiled at all locations.
σ The Danish safety groups will also in
2015 organise a joint health & safety
discussion as well as a joint health &
safety day.
σ Action plans relating to workplace
assessment will be completed and
implemented.
σ In the Baltic countries fire alarms and
warning systems must be upgraded to
reduce the risk in connection with a fire.
σ Finland has a target also for 2015 of
being above industry average when it
comes to occupational health & safety.
This is to be achieved by, among other
things, selected employees in Hartν
wall’s production in Lahti, who have
now been fully trained in the Dupont
STOP program (safety program),

Moreover, in cooperation with our
insurance partner in Finland, a project
has been initiated to increase road safeν
ty primarily among sales consultants.
Furthermore, the rotation level among
production workers in Lahti has been
increased to avoid repetitive work.

RESPONSIBLE ALCOHOLIC
BEVERAGE AND SOFT DRINKS
CONSUMPTION
Royal Unibrew’s commitment to responν
sible marketing and consumption of
beverages is rooted in the following core
principles:
σ We engage consumers and stakeholdν
ers and work collectively with them to
promote responsible enjoyment of our
products.
σ We respect that beer consumption is
for adults only and is a matter of indiν
vidual choice and accountability.

σ We ensure that our marketing pracν
tices are in compliance, at all times,
with the marketing legislation in the
areas in which our products are sold.
σ We value responsibility in our corporate
culture and expect our employees to
demonstrate such responsibility in the

in customers’ communication on conν
sumption of the Company’s products in
relation to advertising, sponsorships and
campaigns. Compliance with marketing
legislation and certain guidelines are
included in Royal Unibrew’s cooperation
agreements with customers.
Royal Unibrew also has a responsibility for
preventing any abuse problems among its
employees. In Denmark a number of key
individuals across the organisation have
been trained in supporting colleagues

In Latvia Royal Unibrew along with other
soft drinks producers supported the
preparation of a joint code for responsiν
ble marketing of soft drinks, and in 2014
campaigns on balanced consumption of
beverages were initiated.
Moreover, the Baltic countries have focus

COMPETENCE DEVELOPMENT
Royal Unibrew works in a targeted and
structured manner to develop employee
competences. These eﬀorts are further
described in the section ”Organisation
and Employees”.

ETHICAL VALUES AND
GUIDELINES
Royal Unibrew’s values and ethical guideν
lines are included as an integrated part
of the employment relationship agreed
with the individual employee. Our ethical
guidelines imply, among other things,
that Royal Unibrew does not tolerate
discrimination of its employees due to
gender, race, religion or political aﬃliation.
Royal Unibrew accedes to the principles
of human rights and labour standards inν

cluding eg the principles on child labour
laid down by UNICEF, the UNGC and Save
the Children.
It is also Royal Unibrew’s aim that suppliν
ers and partners should comply with the
ethical guidelines, and that these should
be incorporated into the Company’s
terms of trading with key suppliers. Royal
Unibrew is only exposed to suppliers
outside the EU to a very limited extent.
Also in 2014 an ethical audit was perν

more than 1.5% below the 2013 figure.
At the Albani brewery in Denmark,
reduced evaporation during wort boilν
ing as well as the installation of an air
preheater on the gas boiler contributed
towards energy savings, and LED lights
at both Danish and foreign breweries
also reduced energy consumption. At the
Faxe brewery, the PET line and cleaning
processes were furthermore optimised,
and buildings were insulated, which
reduced energy consumption further.

of palletisation result in better utilisation
of the vehicle capacity. Moreover, the
average order size has been increased
by 7% in Lithuania and by 6% in Latvia
resulting in lower fuel consumption per
hectolitre distributed.
The Finnish Hartwall brewery initiated
an electricity saving project by replacν

water as well as waste water is used
for heating purposes.

WATER CONSUMPTION AND
WASTE WATER DISCHARGE
Water is an important constituent of Royal
Unibrew’s business, and we are therefore
always on the lookout for new methods to
reduce our water consumption.
Total water consumption was reduced
by 2.1% to 3.3 hectolitres per hectolitre
produced in 2014. Part of the reduction is
attributable to the continued eﬀorts of
optimising cleaning processes, which has
resulted in improved cleaning quality as
well as reduced resource consumption.
At the Faxe brewery in Denmark, the
crate washer was changed so as to
recycle water from the bottle washing
machine, which reduces water as well as
energy consumption.
At the Finnish Hartwall brewery, optimiν
sation of CIP processes (CIP: Cleaning In
Place) as well as up to 20% reduction of
beer and soft drinks wastage resulted in a
positive development in water and energy
consumption per hectolitre produced.
In 2014 waste water discharge was
2.2 hectolitres per hectolitre produced
at group level, which is a 3.4% decline.

RECYCLING AND REDUCTION OF
CONSUMPTION OF RESOURCES
All production sites have strong, continuν
ous focus on consumption, including
recycling, of raw materials and other
resources. Eﬀorts are made to ensure
the best possible utilisation of the raw
materials and resources used in order to
avoid unnecessary wastage. This applies
to production as well as to the other
parts of the supply chain.
In Denmark the Albani brewery estabν
lished recovery of heat from the wort
kettle in 2014. The heat is captured and
returned to the city’s district heating
system to avoid energy waste.

In 2014 the replacement of the distriν
bution vehicles in Denmark with new
vehicles complying with the Euro 6
x*wHx*a*b|φE*ai|* iν4xH*b&[
lorries in the market) was commenced.
This replacement is expected to continue
in future years. The investment in Euro
6 vehicles is considered future proofing
in relation to the increasingly stringent
environmental requirements expected in
Denmark. To Royal Unibrew, the replaceν
ment will imply annual savings in terms
of diesel oil consumption.
In Finland the truck utilisation rate has
gone up significantly due to, among
other things, optimisation of pallet patν
terns and stacking heights. In Denmark
the use of heavy goods vehicles has
increased, which reduces environmental
impacts.
Latvia saw an upgrade of its machinery
in that all diesel and gas trucks were
replaced with electrical trucks, which
reduces CO2 emissions.
Moreover, wood pallets for logistics
purpose in Latvia are being replaced with
plastic pallets whose life cycle is up to
10 times longer. This replacement will
continue in 2015.
The Cido soft drinks factory in Latvia has
started bottling natural mineral water
in EcoForma containers which are up to
20% lighter than the PET bottles previν
ously used. This has reduced packaging
consumption by approx 75 tons of plasν
tic, and emission from production has
been reduced by approx 225 tons.

SELECTED TARGETS FOR 2015
σ All production sites will in 2015
continue working at identifying and
implementing environmental improveν
ment measures. Targets and improveν
ments will be realised locally at the
production sites to ensure the most
optimum implementation. Eﬀorts are
focused on:
σ Optimum utilisation of raw materials
σ Minimisation of wastage from all
process levels

ANNUAL REPORT 2014

σ Energy and water consumption
reductions
σ Increased rate of waste recycling
σ Increased utilisation of transport
capacity
σ Indirect environmental impacts will be
sought reduced through choice of raw
materials, eg by using thinner plastic
materials for packaging purposes.
σ Continuous eﬀorts are directed at reducν
ing consumption of materials for glass
bottles, cans and plastic containers.
σ In Latvia eﬀorts will continue to esν
tablish a return systems for beverage
containers, which is expected to be
introduced in 2016/17.

σ The Egekilde range to be extended
with more CO2 neutral varieties.

CO2 NEUTRAL PRODUCTION OF
ALL EGEKILDE PRODUCTS
Back in 2012 the carbon footprint of the
Egekilde products was mapped throughν
out the chain from raw materials to delivν
ery to Royal Unibrew’s customers, and the
Egekilde brand was launched as the first
Danish CO2 neutral mineral water product.
CO2 neutrality is an ongoing process
achieved by investing in environmenν
[[|ib&*b*x?Exi?Eƾƕν *xH8*&
carbon credits and by means of plastic
containing up to 50% recycled material.
Furthermore, continuous eﬀorts are
directed at reducing energy and resource
consumption with suppliers and within
production and logistics.
In 2014 the size of the screw caps on the
Egekilde bottles was reduced, which reν
duced the total weight of the container.
Each unit has thus achieved a smaller
carbon footprint.
CO2 neutrality contributed towards
Egekilde becoming the market leader in
2014. Egekilde’s CO2 neutrality provides

Selected targets for 2015
σ Updating of carbon footprint of packν
aging, containers and resources in the
Egekilde production.

FOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY
Royal Unibrew’s breweries have certificaν
tion under the international standards.
The eﬀorts within quality and food
safety also comprise requirements from
customers and licensors. Applicable HACν
CP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control
Points) rules have been implemented.
