Corporate social
responsibility (CSR)
and policies
NeuroSearchâ€™s Board of Directors has decided that,
given the current circumstances, it does not make
sense to define additional targets for changing the gender distribution for the Board of Directors and Management. The Board of Directors consists of three members elected by the shareholders, of whom the Chairman is female. The Company has two employees: a
male CEO and a female CFO.

In view of its size and current activities, NeuroSearch
no longer has:
A policy for corporate social responsibility
A policy for respecting human rights
A policy for reducing the climate impact from
the Company's activities

Working environment
The physical working environment has been simplified
in step with the reduction of activities in NeuroSearch.
After the sale of the domicile property, the address was
changed to an office partnership from where the remaining administration is handled.
