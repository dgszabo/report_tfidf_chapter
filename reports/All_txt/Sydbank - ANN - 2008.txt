Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility

Corporate social responsibilitySydbank is a large Danish enterprise operating as a responsibleplayer in society while respecting its business goals. TheGroup’s service philosophy, ”What can we do for you”, is aclear manifestation of social responsibility.Social responsibility incorporates being an active player in theactivites of associations and sports – locally and regionally.Numerous sponsorships are nurtured in Sydbank’s 17 Danishregions – with elite sports people and not least amateur sportsassociations on a much wider front. On top of that Sydbank’sfund gives small and large donations for cultural and socialpurposes. Our local and regional commitment is the cornerstoneof our corporate mission and one of the reasons why weremain the business partner characterised by closeness andlocal knowledge – despite our nationwide presence.Also in relation to its employees the Group takes its socialresponsibility seriously. Continuous initiatives within stress prevention,health promotion and senior policy schemes constitutesome of the reasons why Sydbank is regarded as a highlyattractive workplace. Also in terms of environmental awarenessthe Group has launched a range of initiatives in recent yearsaimed at minimising the Bank’s energy consumption.The joint aim of the Bank’s CSR efforts is to emphasizeSydbank’s position as ethically sound – among employees, clientsand other stakeholders.
