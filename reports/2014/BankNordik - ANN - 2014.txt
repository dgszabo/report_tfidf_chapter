Corporate Governance and
Corporate Responsibility

Corporate responsibility remains an important part ofBankNordik’s strategy. The Group considers responsiblecorporate governance a prerequisite for long-termvalue creation.The Group’s CR initiatives are formalised in a CorporateResponsibility policy. Management believes thatthe Group’s CR initiatives will yield the best resultsif there is a natural connection between such activitiesand the Group’s business strategy and core competences.Therefore, the BankNordik Group’s CR activitiesand initiatives are strategically rooted in theGroup’s vision, business strategy, core competenciesand business values.
