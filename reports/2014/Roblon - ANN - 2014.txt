Statutory statement
of corporate social
responsibility
Roblon	has	not	come	up	with	a	structured	approach	to	explain	
the	relationship	between	CSR	and	value-creating	business	operations,	and	for	this	reason	has	not	adopted	policies	for	the	
area.

As	a	consequence	of	this,	there	is	no	separate	statement	for	the	
area.
Similarly,	Roblon	does	not	have	any	policies	in	place	on	human	
rights	or	reducing	climate	change.
