Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
As at the date of this annual report, Nordic Shipholding does not have a written CSR policy due to
the functional structure of the Company, where all corporate, commercial and technical
management have been outsourced to external management service providers. Depending on the
future developments of the Company, a CSR policy will be developed accordingly.
