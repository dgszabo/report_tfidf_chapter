In addition to carrying on profitable business activities, TK Development intends to adhere to and expand the Group’s ethical,
social and environmental responsibilities as a business corporation.
TK Development fundamentally endorses the UN’s ten social
responsibility principles, but has not acceded to the UN Global
Compact.
In light of the Company’s size and activities and the Group’s
operating markets, the Board of Directors has decided not to
adopt policies for the voluntary integration of corporate social
responsibility or human rights and climate policies. The Board
will regularly assess the need for policies in this area.
