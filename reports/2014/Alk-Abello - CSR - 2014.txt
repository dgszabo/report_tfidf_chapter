Statutory Report on Corporate Social Responsibility for 2014
This Statutory Report on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), cf. sections 99a and 99b of the
Danish Financial Statements Act, is part of the Management’s review in the 2014 Annual Report and
covers the financial period 1 January - 31 December 2014.

Social responsibility
As an international pharmaceutical company, ALK has an important social responsibility. ALK strives
to live up to this responsibility and be recognised by its stakeholders as a reliable and responsible
company characterised by professionalism, honesty and integrity.

Code of Conduct
As ALK is growing and becoming an increasingly global company, there is an even greater need for a
common frame of reference for social responsibility and ethical behaviour.
ALK’s Code of Conduct, which was developed in 2008, launched in 2009 and updated in 2013,
describes the ethical requirements for all employees’ behaviour in relation to customers, employees,
shareholders, society, suppliers and partners. The Code of Conduct aims to support a working
environment where daily business is conducted with professionalism, honesty and integrity, and in the
best interests of ALK and its stakeholders.
ALK supports the UN Global Compact’s 10 principles in the areas of human and labour rights,
environment and anti-corruption. These principles are integrated in the Code of Conduct and have
become a global frame of reference for ALK’s CSR activities.
In 2014, the updated Code of Conduct was launched. All managers are responsible for ensuring that
each individual employee is informed about the content of the Code of Conduct and the importance of
adhering to it. The observation of the Code of Conduct rests upon all employees and all employees
are encouraged to report issues, concerns and any breach of the Code of Conduct. The Code of
Conduct is available http://www.alk-abello.com/aboutalk/csr/businessethics/Pages/home.aspx.

CSR Policy
Based on the Code of Conduct, and anchored in ALK’s core values (Progressive – Trustworthy –
Focused – United), the Board of Directors has established a CSR Policy that outlines the key CSR
priorities. The policy covers all parts of ALK's organisation, including affiliates, and it is implemented
via various policies and procedures, including HR policies, SHE (Safety Health & Environment) action
plans and organisations, quality procedures etc. The CSR policy is communicated internally to the
employees and externally to other stakeholders.
According to the CSR Policy, ALK aims to run its business on a profitable and sustainable basis,
offering products that improve patients' quality of life through prevention, diagnosis and treatment of
respiratory allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma. ALK conducts its activities in a socially responsible
manner while adhering to UN Global Compact's 10 principles.
The CSR Policy was originally adopted in 2011 by the Board of Directors. In 2014, the Board of
Directors updated the policy, resolving that ALK focuses its efforts on three areas:
•
•

Production/environment: ALK has set targets for the company's total energy consumption and
its CO2 emissions.
Ethical conduct: In addition to the Code of Conduct, which all employees must observe, ALK
has established a whistleblowing scheme to provide the opportunity for confidential reporting
of serious offences.

•

Employees: ALK has a long tradition of working systematically to improve the working
environment and promote well-being at work. ALK has set targets for work-related absence,
just as competence development of the employees is a focus area.

ALK is committed to prevent, diagnose and treat respiratory allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma. ALK
cooperates with relevant stakeholders, e.g. authorities, private and public institutions and nongovernmental organisations to promote the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of respiratory allergic
rhinitis and allergic asthma. In 2014 ALK introduced Allergy Unlocked™ - a series of initiatives aiming
at easing access to treatment for patients and raising allergy up the healthcare agenda. As part of the
2014 update of the CSR policy ALK's activities to fight allergy will in future be part of ALK's Allergy
Unlocked™ agenda to ensure synergy between activities.

CSR focus areas
1. Production/environment
ALK works systematically to improve working environment and environmental conditions in every area
of the company, supported by the local SHE (Safety, Health, Environment) organisations at all
production sites. ALK has been environmentally certified (ISO 14001) in Denmark since 2007 and was
recertified for another three years in 2013. The other production sites in Spain, France, the
Netherlands, the USA and Canada adhere to the SHE standards.
In 2009, the Management adopted global long-term goals for the SHE-related activities focusing on
the reduction of energy consumption, including CO2 emissions. The objective is that absolute energy
1
consumption in 2014 will not have increased compared to the consumption in 2008 while CO2
emissions will have decreased by at least 15%. New targets have been set for 2015-2018 and the
overall efforts have been extended to encompass water usage.
Results in 2014
Despite implementation of energy projects, including improvements of ventilation and cooling systems
as well as roof coating lowering building temperatures, the energy consumption in real terms has
increased by 3% over baseline (2008) due to the expansion of the supply chain network. Hence, the
original target is not met.
By 2014, ALK has reduced the CO2 emission with more than 3300 tonnes compared to 2008. This
equals a 28% reduction of CO2 emission from the base year 2008 vs. the original target of 15%.
In 2014, ALK received no complaints and experienced no unintended spills.
Future plans
ALK has set new targets for 2015-2018. ALK will continue to identify and implement appropriate
energy reduction projects at existing production sites and incorporate energy saving technologies on
new sites. The target is that energy consumption by-end 2018 must not exceed the consumption in
2014.
As a result of the above-mentioned efforts as well as continued support of renewable energy
production (e. g. wind power), the new target for CO2 emission is that CO2 emission by end-2018, must
be 5% less compared to the 2014-level.

Consumption and emissions in 2008 will be adjusted in terms of establishment of new production sites, closure of old
production sites, acquisitions, etc.

Furthermore, ALK has decided to take a more systematic approach to water usage, reflecting that
clean water is scarce particularly in Europe. Consequently, ALK will identify and implement reduction
projects at existing production sites in Europe and incorporate water saving technologies when
building/re-building facilities. The target is that water usage at the European sites by end-2018, must
not exceed the usage in 2014 despite increased activities. ALK will report the total usage at all sites
but the goal will only apply for the European sites.

2. Ethical conduct
In 2009, ALK launched its ALK Code of Conduct in order to support professionalism, honesty and
integrity throughout the company and in relation with customers, employees, shareholders, society,
suppliers and partners. All employees are required to adhere to ALK’s Code of Conduct, which
integrates and supports the UN Global Compact’s 10 principles.
All employees are required to adhere to ALK’s Code of Conduct.
ALK's commitment to managing human rights in our business is contained in the ALK Code of
Conduct. In the Code of Conduct we describe the requirements we have established for our actions
and behaviours. We support the UN Global Compact’s 10 principles, not least in the areas of human
and labour rights, the environment and anti-corruption and we have integrated these principles in the
ALK Code of Conduct. To see ALK’s Code of Conduct please visit http://www.alkabello.com/aboutalk/csr/businessethics/Pages/home.aspx.
ALK encourages suppliers and partners to adhere to the same standards in the areas of human and

labour rights, the environment and anti-corruption.
All employees are encouraged to report issues, concerns and any breach of the Code of Conduct. For
employees, who observe potentially illegal or unethical behaviour, but do not feel that they can talk to
their manager or a colleague about it, ALK has launched the whistle-blower scheme ‘ALK Alertline’.
This scheme gives employees with knowledge of potentially destructive or illegal acts related to ALK’s
activities the opportunity to report their observations at have them investigated in full confidentiality.
The scheme minimises the risk of illegalities and irregularities within the areas of financial crime,
environmental pollution or inappropriate conduct, as well as other circumstances that may be to the
detriment of ALK.
Results in 2014
In 2014, the revised Code of Conduct was launched. To ensure compliance, all 55 members of ALKs
international management forum confirmed that they had communicated the Code of Conduct in their
organisation.
No reports have been filed through the ALK Alertline in 2014. No breeches of the Code of Conduct
have otherwise been reported.
Future plans
In 2015, to ensure compliance all employees will be asked to confirm that they are acquainted with the
ALK Code of Conduct.
3. Employees
ALK employs 1910 employees in 18 countries, of whom 704 are employed in Denmark. ALK wishes to
continue to be an attractive workplace that can attract and retain competent and engaged employees.
To obtain this and to respect the employees’ human rights, ALK works systematically to improve
safety and the working environment, including the psychosocial working environment, and to develop
an organisation, culture and management style that encourage professional and personal
development. In this way we also ensure that the human rights of our employees are respected.

Safety
ALK has a long tradition of working systematically to improve working environment and conditions.
ALK in Denmark has been health and safety certified (OHSAS 18001) since 2007 and in 2013 ALK
was recertified for another three years.
In 2009, Management adopted global and long-term goals for the improvement of safety and wellbeing at work. The goal is to reduce the number of absence days per employee due to incidents at
work on a continuous basis.
Results in 2014
In 2014, the number of days of absence due to work-related injuries decreased to 0,039 days per
employee, which is a reduction of 15% compared to the average in the preceding three years.
Compared to base year 2008, the number of absence due to work-related injuries decreased by 75%.
Page 4 of 6

Hence, the target has been met.
Future plans
ALK has set new targets for 2015-2018 to ensure safe and good working conditions. ALK’s goal is that
the number of accidents with absence per 1 million work hours by end-2018 must be not exceed 4.0 at
a 3-year average based on sustained efforts by local SHE organisations and managers.
Organisation, culture and management
Over the past 5 years, ALK has worked to establish a performance culture. To further strengthen the
ability to execute the strategy and to support a uniform performance management process, every
manager and employee agree expectations to goals and behaviour.
ALK has identified “Daily Work” as the Key Performance Indicator to track employee satisfaction and
well-being at work. This KPI is part of Engagement Surveys, which is performed every second year.
Results in 2014
No Engagement Survey was conducted in 2014. The next Engagement Survey is scheduled for 2015.
Future plans
ALK reviews the organisation on an annual basis to determine whether the structure, resources and
competences are fit to reach the strategic goals.
As for well-being at work, ALK will continue to support HR activities to e.g. sustain a reasonable worklife balance and ALK will also incorporate good physical working conditions when building/re-building
facilities. The target is to obtain the score ≥75 on the action area “Daily Work” in the 2019
Engagement Survey.
Diversity
ALK seeks diversity as one of the prerequisites for the company's success and this naturally includes
equal opportunities for men and women to pursue a management career in ALK.
In 2013, the Board of Directors defined a target to increase the proportion of women among the
shareholder-elected board members to one or two by 2018. ALK also strives to increase the
proportion of the under-represented genders at other management levels.
Results in 2014
In 2014, the number of female shareholder-elected members of the Board of Directors grew from none
to one, corresponding to 17%, in accordance with the overall target of one or two members by 2018.
Including employee-elected members, female members constitute 33% of the Board of Directors.
The number of female members on the Board of Management likewise grew from none to one,
corresponding to 20%. There are <three> women among the <22> functional managers. However,
among first-line managers and mid-level managers the share of women is considerably higher. The
share of women is <30%> among mid-level managers and <50%> among first-line managers,
including e.g. R&D team leaders. Overall, women account for <42%> of all managers in ALK.
Future plans
ALK will continue its efforts and commitment towards equal opportunities for women and men at all
management levels.
One way to ensure this is to consider both male and female candidates in connection with internal and
Page 5 of 6

external executive recruitment and that at least one candidate from the under-represented sex is on
the short list when recruiting for management positions. Furthermore, it will be ensured that both
women and men are part of ALK's talent pools for management positions.
ALK wishes to have more attention to women's career progression and development and will offer
female managers participation in networks or mentoring schemes.
When conducting the yearly Organisational Review, ALK will have increased focus on monitoring the
share of women at all management levels.
