DFDS aspires to act responsibly when
we carry passengers and freight on our
ships and provide transport and logistics solutions to manufacturers.
This includes goals for reducing our
impact on the environment, keeping
people and goods safe, securing jobs
and good working conditions, taking
social initiatives and being a diverse
company as regards nationality, gender,
race and age. We also act to protect our
company against fraud and to communicate and engage with our stakeholders
in a trustworthy manner.

This is all part of our efforts to create
value for both society and our stakeholders.
Every year, we strive to make progress
in our Corporate Responsibility work.
We support new initiatives that benefit
our environment and other stakeholder
groups, as long as it is done on equal
terms for all parties involved. Our
investment in scrubbers demonstrates
our will and ability to react efficiently to
major environmental challenges in line
with our The DFDS Way operating model based on continuous improvement,

and doings things a little better every
day in all parts of our company.
In the following pages, we report on
the results of our CR work in 2014, our
policies, our processes and systems,
and our plans for securing continuous
improvements in the future.

SAFETY AND SECURITY
AT SEA
CONTINUOUS
IMPROVEMENT
AND FOCUS ON
SAFETY TRAINING
AND DRILLS

Highlights
•	 No fatalities recorded in 2014
•	 Two boiler fires on ships
•	 Ship collision with a quay
Training and drills save lives
The DFDS Way is to enhance performance through continuous improvements, and we believe that the major
tools in achieving continuous improvements in our health and safety
standards are training and drills on
board our ships. We believe that the
training standards and frequent drills
were instrumental in the crew’s ability to fight a major fire in 2013 on
our freight ship Britannia Seaways.
They also prevented minor boiler
fires on Calais Seaways and Dieppe
Seaways in 2014 from developing
into major incidents.
DFDS’ Vice President of Marine Standards addressed an IMO meeting in
September 2014. He emphasised that
more focus should be on training and
drills involving the crew rather than
the growing administrative burden
experienced on board. The issue was
supported by the IMO and by Captain Andreas Kristensen of Britannia
Seaways when he addressed the IMO
in November. He had accepted, with
thanks, the IMO Award for Exceptional
Bravery at Sea, given to him and his
crew for their brave handling of the fire
on board in 2013.

In line with our strategy, DFDS aims to
participate in drills in cooperation with
various rescue and emergency authorities. A full-scale drill in 2014 included
King Seaways in a drill involving the
British, Dutch and French authorities at
the same time. The cooperation with the
rescue authorities included drills that
simulated terrorist attacks on ships. We
welcome this cooperation and believe
that these drills are extremely valuable
when it comes to improving the safety
and security of our passengers and crews.
Lost Time Injuries frequency shows
unsatisfactory regional variations
The Lost Time Injury (LTI) frequency rate
provides an overview of the number of
work-related injuries in the past year.
DFDS measures the LTI frequency rate
in work-related incidents per million
working hours that cause absence from
work for more than 24 hours.
No major injuries were recorded in
2014.
However, the frequency of LTIs
increased from 6.84 in 2013 to 9.31
in 2014. The increase is mainly due
to a poor performance on our Frenchflagged ships, where back pains and
minor cuts are the major reasons.
It should be taken into consideration that
DFDS operates a number of passenger
ships with a large number of non-ma-

rine staff (catering) where we see very
minor cuts to hands causing a high LTI
frequency for hygiene reasons because
the affected people work with food. This
accounts for a major difference in the average LTI frequency between passenger
ships (10.29) and cargo ships (4.30).
However, the LTI frequency in our
French fleet is unacceptable and will be
addressed in 2015. In order to reduce
LTI frequency on board our ships, DFDS
has started working with the Danish
SEAHEALTH occupational health service
(Søfartens Arbejdsmiljøråd). Its experts
come on board our ships to assess and
document the risks and train the crew
in safe routines and strategies to limit
the risks.

actions are not taken. DFDS’ policy is to
support the reporting of near-miss incidents in order to develop best practices
in avoiding and reacting efficiently to
near misses. In 2014, 62.3 near misses
were reported on average per ship. This
is a satisfactory level and in line with
the average number of reports in 2013,
and well above our target.
Future steps / commitments 2015/16
•	Reduce the number of crew accidents
on board French-flagged ships
•	Maintain progress towards zero
lost time accidents across the
rest of the fleet
•	Continue improvement in safetyrelated performance.

Near misses are hazardous occurrences

Our approach
All ships are surveyed and certified
according to international, EU and
national legislation. They are also
subject to internal audits and inspections for safety, labour conditions and
security according to statutory instruments and company procedures.
Under the International Safety Management (ISM) code, the International Ship
and Port Facility Security code (ISPS)
and the Maritime Labour Convention
(MLC) , all maritime safety measures
and security factors must be reported
for all ships on an ongoing basis, and
all ships must report any incidents on
board. This can be done anonymously
under a ‘no blame’ policy according to
company procedures and international
safety guidelines.

Our Marine Standards experts, People
& Ships VPs and CEO meet monthly to
review formally the ships’ safety-related performance. Core to this process is
a review of all safety and operational
data collected from ships in readiness
for inspection by maritime authorities.
Such reviews are published to all ships
and key shore-based managers.
DFDS’ Health, Safety and Environment
Policy, which is reviewed annually by
Management, is designed to deliver
improvement through active demonstration of commitment and leadership. This
means practising what we preach, with
all managers behaving in a way that
demonstrates safety and accountability.

SAFETY CULTURE DEVELOPMENT
IS COMPLEMENTARY TO THE
OVERALL CULTURE OF THE DFDS
WAY, WHICH AMONG OTHER
THINGS PROMOTES CONTINUOUS
IMPROVEMENT AND SHARING OF
BEST PRACTICES.

SAFETY AND SECURITY
ASHORE
Highlights
•	No fatalities recorded in 2014
•	Accident frequency has decreased
	 -	Accident severity has increased
	 -	Most accidents caused by
individual’s actions rather than
failure of systems
•	E-learning tool enhances safety
training and raises awareness of
safety risks
Lower accident frequency,
but more severe injuries
DFDS is an organisation in continuous
growth, and this also applies to the
land-based activities, port terminals,
warehouses, offices and transport
operations. Therefore, we have decided
to measure our land-based safety
performance by means of an Accident
Frequency Rate (AFR) rather than the
number of accidents. In this way, we
will get a true picture of the safety
performance that reflects the actual
risk to individual employees and can be
compared from year to year.
In 2014, DFDS recorded an AFR of 6.22.
This is a 12% improvement compared
to 2013.
However, we did not reach our 15%
improvement target. That would have
been an AFR of 5.80, or 42 Lost Time
Accidents (LTAs), with 3,572 land-based
employees in 2014.

Injury severity represented by lost working days significantly increased in 2014
compared to 2013; the average number
of lost days per LTA more than doubled
from 12 in 2013 to 26 in 2014.

Enhanced safety training
The accidents are, by and large,
caused by individuals’ actions rather
than there being a failure of safety
management systems; this is a continuing trend from 2013. Therefore,
the solution is to increase individuals’
personal awareness of safety as part
of the overall development of DFDS’
safety culture. In order to raise awareness and knowledge about safety
among staff, DFDS has introduced
e-learning safety modules so people
can receive online safety training.
This has greatly improved the number
of people who have received safety
training. In 2014, 2,320 e-learning
safety modules were completed.

There is a suite of six core safety
modules with common applicability
across the Group (Risk Assessment,
Fire, Manual Handling, Slip/Trip, Display
Screen Equipment and Environment)
plus several site specific modules
such as food safety for Belfast – and
each module takes approximately 30
minutes to complete. A module is only
counted as complete when an 80% pass
mark is achieved.
Future steps/commitments
E-learning tools will continue to contribute to improved safety by raising
awareness of safety throughout the
organisation.
Dutch language versions of the core
safety modules have been prepared to
make the material more user-friendly.
French language modules will be generated in 2015.

Our approach
Safety management is operated
by the local management teams
to maintain flexibility and proportionality of response based on risk.
Thus, more safety controls and
formalised inspection regimes are
operated for higher risk activities
(port terminals) than lower risk
activities (offices).
The national and international safety legislation applicable across the
DFDS Group has a common basis in
EU legislation. This allows for an internal safety management standard
for the DFDS Group based on a UK
model of safety management.

Reporting
•	The reporting system is both simple, so as to not overburden small
low-risk units, and yet sophisticated enough to allow the reporting
of injury accident detail allowing
generation of causal analysis.
•	The network of ‘data responders’
covers 55 operational sites
•	Causal analysis is used to inform
managers of trends and to feed into
managers’ ‘safety action plans’ to
ensure the proactive management
of safety.
Safety performance data is collated
into a monthly report made available to management. The reporting
system has been developed to seek
increased causal understanding.

The target for 2015 will be a 15% improvement in the AFR from the 2012
baseline.

The purpose of our HR activities is to
support people as well as the business
in making the right decisions when it
comes to recruitment, employee and
management development, talent
spotting, performance management,
compensation and benefits as well as
organisational efficiency.
In 2014, this was done with special
focus on leadership and personal
development, by means of increased
training and succession planning for
those next in line. There was also focus
on diversity and our trainee and apprenticeship programmes. In addition to this,
DFDS offers an extensive introduction
package to new employees.

DFDS’ HR policy
We will lead an international and
competent workforce that consistently understands our customers’
needs – a workforce that shows passion and thrives in an environment
with inclusive behaviours. DFDS will
at all times seek to ensure we have
the right candidate for a position
regardless of gender, age, religion,
nationality or ethnicity.
Talent and capability development
To enhance our training and development activities substantially, a Training and Development department was
established in 2012. The department
has since been expanded with new
staff and expertise.
The training conducted in 2014 falls

In January 2014, the scheme was
expanded to include Engine Rating
Apprentices and at the end of 2014
another two-year programme for an
additional six deck apprentices was
initiated. The result of these initiatives
is that for every person retiring over
the coming years, a newly qualified

hand will be waiting in the wings.
Having gained any one of our Ratings,
apprentices can, if they have the right
competence and aptitude, become
a Captain or Chief Engineer within a
space of 15 years. This is made possible
through the long-standing Rating to

In our Board of Directors we have a
female representation of 33%, excluding
employee elected members, which is the
minimum requirement of Danish law.
We aim to increase the number of
women in senior management positions
during the next couple of years. The lack
of women in management positions was
a special focal point on DFDS’ annual
management conference in September
2014 where diversity was discussed at
seminars headed by our CEO. To improve
the gender balance in management,
we are analysing the dynamics of the
imbalance to improve our understanding
and develop efficient solutions.
Major HR and crewing changes in 2014
Following the closure of the EsbjergHarwich route, we were, by means of
long-term planning, able to offer the
110 crew members working on the
route jobs on other ships in our network.
After DIEPPE SEAWAYS, deployed on
Dover-Calais, was returned to its owner at
the end of November 2014, we succeeded

relief to know that Sine can save her
energy and concentrate on what’s most
important for her right now,” he says.

In many communities, we are part of
local life and take an active interest in
community issues, including job creation
and support of community initiatives.

Helping young people escape crime
In Denmark, DFDS is cooperating closely
with the High:Five project, which is a
community project to find jobs in private companies for young people with a
criminal record. The aim is to offer a way
back to a crime-free life via a normal
job. In 2014, DFDS employed ten young
former criminals, mainly on our ships on
the Oslo-Copenhagen route. On board a
ship, the working environment is dedicated and supportive, and about 80% of
the participants in the programme leave
crime behind permanently.

Some of the initiatives taken by DFDS
in 2014 were:
Employee welfare
In partnership with the Danish union DMMA, we have established a
joint foundation to provide financial
support to employees, covered by the
agreements negotiated by the DMMA,
enabling them to work part-time if they
are unable to work full-time for health
reasons. In 2014, seven persons benefited from the scheme. The agreement is
unique in the Danish labour market.
Den Sociale Fond
Serious illness can affect the entire
household. When Kristian Kristensen’s
partner, Sine, was diagnosed with a
brain tumour, he requested that his promotion to captain from first officer on
PEARL SEAWAYS be put on hold. Nevertheless, it was hard getting everything
done at home on 2-weeks on / 2-weeks
off rotations. Help turned out to be close
at hand. He was supported by the Social
Market Labour Fund, so he could con-

Youngster from the High:Five
partnership passes final
apprenticeship test
After having served a sentence for
crime, Allan Sørensen started with
three months’ work experience
in the engine room on CROWN
SEAWAYS in 2011, and after just
a month, the chief engineer could
see that there was something special about Allan. We therefore offered to take him on as an apprentice ship’s mechanic. He grabbed
the chance, and in December 2014
he passed the apprenticeship test
as a ship’s mechanic.

Inspiration from the Lauritzen
Foundation
In our community work, we are
inspired by our major shareholder, the Lauritzen Foundation,
that contributes funds to society
every year. Support is given to
both cultural and social activities,
including helping people in need
in developing countries. In total,
the Lauritzen Foundation annually donates around DKK 25m.

DFDS has taken a leading role in this
initiative: Henrik Holck, EVP of DFDS’
People & Ships Division, has stepped in
as chairman of High:Five. As a result of
these and other social initiatives, DFDS
has been awarded a seat on the Danish
government’s advisory committee for
corporate social responsibility, where
we share our experiences and contribute
to developing social initiatives.
Christmas lunch for the homeless
DFDS offered a free Christmas lunch to
homeless people on board our passenger
ships in Copenhagen, Oslo and Amsterdam before Christmas. The invitations
were issued in cooperation with local

based on voluntary work done by DFDS
employees. About 600 homeless people
enjoyed a free Christmas lunch at DFDS.
Danish Community Award
DFDS has supported a Danish Community Award initiative. The Award
­‘Fællesskabsprisen’ is initiated by the
Danish Government and aims at awarding those individuals or groups that put
in an extra effort in making their community, their work place or other social
spaces a better place for people to live.
In 2014, DFDS offered to host the Award
ceremony on a complimentary basis on
our passenger ship PEARL SEAWAYS.
1,200 initiatives were nominated for the
award, of which 10 were awarded.

ENVIRONMENT

Laws and regulations at sea
Much of our environmental
efforts are aimed at complying
with regulations and conventions issued by a number of regulators. The most important are
The United Nations’ International Maritime Organization (IMO),
the European Union and the
relevant national governments.

DFDS received global
environmental recognition
In 2014, DFDS received Lloyd’s
List Global Award and The Environmental Performance Award at
the annual Marine Propulsion &
Auxiliary Machinery Awards for
our scrubber investment. At The
Ship Technology Conference in
Norway, DFDS was voted Green
Shipowner of the Year.

Therefore, DFDS believes that currently
the scrubber solution is the best alternative when it comes to the environment.
DFDS is investing DKK 750m in refitting
ships with scrubbers. In 2014, scrubbers were installed on seven ships.
This increased the number of DFDS
ships operating with a scrubber to 11
and makes DFDS leading in scrubber
re-fitting globally. A further six scrubber
installations are planned for 2015,
and other means of reducing sulphur
dioxide pollution and complying with
the new regulations, such as using LNG,
are being considered for the future. In

installations are planned for 2015.

general, we believe the LNG solution is
more efficient for new ships.
In 2014, DFDS was granted up to EUR
6.2m from EU primarily for scrubber
refitting.
DFDS on track with target for reduction
of CO2 emissions
In 2014, we continued and increased
our efforts to reduce CO2 emissions.
More than 95% of DFDS’ emissions
stem from bunker consumption on our
ships and focus has therefore been
on this area with an extensive bunker
reduction programme in the centre of
our efforts. However, in 2014, steps
were taken for a structured programme
to also reduce our shore-based energy
consumption and emissions.
At sea
DFDS is on track to reach our target of
further reducing energy consumption
at sea by 5% from 2012 to 2017. The
most efficient ways of reducing bunker
consumption on board are lower speed
at sea and consolidation of volumes on
bigger ships. However, many smaller
initiatives together also produce substantial fuel savings.

2015

New sulphur rules and scrubbers
Sulphur emissions from ships was
the main environmental challenge for
DFDS in 2014. From 1 January 2015,
new sulphur rules in the Baltic Sea,
the North Sea and the English Channel
prohibit use of bunker oil that contains
more than 0.1% sulphur. Up until 2015,
use of bunker oil with 1.0% sulphur
was allowed.

The overall aim of the rules is to reduce
the sulphur dioxide pollution from ships
in these densely populated regions.
Therefore, other means that can produce
the same result are also allowed as an
alternative to using low sulphur oil, and
since 2009 DFDS has already successfully tested a scrubber that efficiently
removes sulphur dioxide from ships’
exhaust gases. The scrubber solution
can be a financially better solution for
some ships compared to using the more
expensive low sulphur fuel, and it has
some additional environmental benefits: It reduces the emission of particles
from the exhaust gas by about 80%.

ESTIMATED

In 2014, the major environmental initiatives were preparing for the new sulphur
rules that came into force on 1 January
2015 as well as continuing the work to
reduce CO2 emissions.

REDUCING OUR
IMPACT ON THE
ENVIRONMENT

Our main means of reducing our ships’
bunker consumption and emissions
are improvements in our ship-shore
cooperation, behaviours on board and
technical solutions.

OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES HAVE AN IMPACT
ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND, THEREFORE, WE
ARE CONSTANTLY SEARCHING FOR INNOVATIVE
AND INTELLIGENT WAYS TO DEVELOP DFDS IN
A GREENER DIRECTION. IT IS OUR POLICY TO
CONSIDER THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF
EVERYTHING WE DO.
Niels Smedegaard

MAIN MEANS FOR REDUCING FUEL
CONSUMPTION ON BOARD
Ship-Shore cooperation
Slow sailing is essential when it
comes to reducing fuel consumption
on board. Through structured efforts,
we aim at finding more time for
reducing speed at sea without delays
for our customers. Therefore, shoreship cooperation that can reduce the
time in port is extremely important.
This includes improvement of sailing
plans, coordination between ship and
shore on arrival and departure, load
planning and stevedoring.
Technical optimisation
DFDS continuously evaluates and invests in new energy saving technical
solutions: This includes
•	e-navigation, including IT programmes, which plan optimal
sailings based on very detailed and
continuously updated information
about the ship, route, weather and
other sailing conditions.
•	optimisation of engines,
•	use of more energy-optimised
propellers and rudders
•	hundreds of other technical improvements on each ship, ranging from
improved pumps, heating, lighting to
ventilation and galley equipment.

Improved behaviour on board
Individual employees and teams can
significantly influence energy consumption through their behaviour
on board. Therefore, DFDS is continuously communicating individual
as well as Group efforts in order to
share best practices among ships
and other involved persons.
Monitoring
DFDS continuously monitors fuel
consumption for all ships in gram
per Nautical mile per Gross Tonnes
in order to have comparable monitoring basis for all ships	
CO2 regulations to comply with
DFDS considers it to be a problem
that varying legislative bodies like
single nations, the EU and the UN
(IMO) introduce legislation in the
same area. To the benefit of international trade, DFDS supports uniform
international regulations instead of
separate national legislation.
In 2014, DFDS’ total fuel consumption at sea was 487,000 tonnes.

Environment

Other initiatives to enhance DFDS’
environmental performance at
sea include:
Our waste handling programme, initiatives to reduce noise and a number
of programmes aimed at reducing
the domestic energy consumption
through improved lightning, ventilation and automation.
Reducing energy consumption
and emission ashore
Ashore at port terminals and in our
warehousing and road transport
activities, we strive to reduce energy
consumption through the establishment
of Energy Management teams. The work
involves a number of initiatives such
as replacing trucks with more fuel efficient ones and larger units, plus more
efficient planning and monitoring tools
to reduce empty driving. The enhanced
use of telematics and improved driving
skills are also key contributors to our
environmental programme.

dictated by these organisations. Work
that is not yet completed. For our
activities in the EU the Energy Efficiency Directive will entail we perform the
required independently audited energy
surveys. The first of which is due by the
end of 2015.
In addition to the initiatives required
by legislation, DFDS is also working on
other initiatives that goes beyond these
standards.

FREIGHT CUSTOMERS
GREATER FOCUS
ON CUSTOMERS
IN 2014

Highlights 2014
•	Customer satisfaction a high strategic
priority
•	Group-wide Customer Focus Initiative
and DFDS Way of Selling continue
•	DFDS again voted ‘World’s leading
ferry operator’

Our approach
DFDS’ aim is to be recognised
as the preferred supplier in its
dealings with customers. To
continuously achieve this goal
our actions are guided by the five
principles of DFDS’ guiding star
for customer focus.
These five principles are enshrined in the daily working life of
all DFDS offices and set measureable targets to:
•	Deliver superior reliability and
schedules
•	Constantly bring new solutions
to customers
•	Be easy to work with
•	Deliver customer service by
empowered people with cando attitudes
•	Ensure we provide fast communication when it matters.

Increasing customer satisfaction
In 2014, DFDS continued to focus keenly on customer service by means of the
Customer Focus Initiative, (CFI).

certificates at various stages and is
designed to enhance long-term development in the relationship between the
customer and DFDS.

A successful tool has been the many
local staff and customer townhall meetings held at DFDS locations throughout
our network during the year. At those
meetings, customer companies are
invited to join DFDS staff meetings to
present their companies, their products,
developments and needs as well as the
challenges they face.

The close customer contact has also
led to many enhancements such as improved communication via SMS, email
or telephone with our customers if there
are delays or disruption to services.

Following the major CFI customer
surveys in previous years, and to
understand our customers’ needs and
challenges further, as well as their experience of DFDS’ customer service, we
also conduct shorter customer surveys
via email. Based on the findings, we
continued to develop The DFDS Way
of Selling, which is a specially developed DFDS sales and service training
programme. The aim is to help our sales
force gain a deep understanding of the
needs and challenges of our customers’ businesses and create solutions to
address these needs.
This process calls for collective interaction with the customer and investing
time to agree and construct proposals
that add value to their business. In
order to develop the service quality of
our sales force, the programme awards

A useful tool for mobile booking has
been developed for some ferry routes,
information about services, or the
national regulations affecting drivers, in
the shape of folders in various languages as well as other solutions that
support our customers in their business.
In our logistics business, it has led to
the development of tracking tools so
our customers in some areas can track
their shipments on-line.
Delivering sustainable solutions
Transport is a critical part of the supply chain and a critical part of our customers’ environmental performance.
The environmental performance of our
transport services is a vital element
in our customers’ ability to serve their
end customers in a resource- and cost-­
effective manner.
Therefore we see it as our responsibility
to develop solutions that will help our
customers minimise the effect their
business has on the environment.

As can be seen in the chapter about our
environmental performance in 2014,
DFDS is in the process of refitting a
major part of the fleet with scrubbers,
which can remove sulphur from the
exhaust gas in order to comply with
a new set of sulphur regulations. The
scrubbers also bring about a reduction
in the emission of particles, making it
a sounder environmental solution than
using low-sulphur oil.
Our ability to measure and report on
our usage of fuel and to have proactive
targets to reduce our CO2 emissions
is an increasingly important element
of customer service. DFDS now offers
customers a tool to measure CO2 usage
on many routes and also a comparison
with other transport modes. Customers
can now measure the benefit of switching shipping routes or switching from
road to rail and can actively track the
benefits over the year.
In 2014, we continued our extensive
fuel reduction programme for our ships
as reported under the section on environment. It also included the opportunity to use our intermodal solutions on
longer transports, including rail, which
reduces the carbon footprint dramatically. Furthermore, DFDS has invested
in more modern trucks and trailers to
reduce the fuel consumption per unit
transported, thus benefiting our customers’ environmental performance. This

included the use of larger units such as
15.65-metre trailers in the UK, double
deck trailers and super cube trailers.
The additional capacity can reduce
road journeys and hence contribute
to less road congestion and fewer CO2
emissions. It also gives our customers a
significant cost saving in their distribution costs.
In line with The DFDS Way of operating,
we are continuously improving our
daily operations of our logistics services
through better planning tools and pooling of equipment in order to increase
services and reduce empty driving.
This reduces costs and our contribution
to congestion on the roads as well
emissions.
DFDS’ code of conduct
DFDS has developed a code of conduct,
which is available from DFDS’ website. It is, among other things, a tool
to enable customers to feel confident
about DFDS’ way of operating, including
compliance with laws, regulations and
ethical standards.

Next steps/commitments 2014/2015
•	Expand cooperation with major customers on health and safety
•	Launch of new website focused on
best practice in health and safety and
driver training
•	New driver training programme to
ensure both our drivers and subcontractors are fully conversant with our
standards
•	Explore opportunities to reduce carbon
footprint by using bio fuel and/or food
customers’ waste food oils converted
into road fuel
•	Reduce miles from source to end customer in food logistics in partnership
with major customers by mapping
supply chains, including storage locations

comprehensive refitting of both ships on
the Copenhagen-Oslo route in 2014 was
based on more than 60,000 customer
responses to surveys carried out over
three years.

A further key goal is to offer our customers throughout Europe an experience that
meets or exceeds their expectations.

Data protection
Our customer improvement projects
require addressing customers’ needs
through analysis of customer information. DFDS consistently respects data
privacy and complies with the European
Data Protection Directive (95/46/ EC) as
well as with the national data protection
acts in the countries where we operate.
Marketing communication is sent only to
individuals who have explicitly agreed
to accept it. DFDS further follows the
mandates of the proposed European
General Data Protection Regulation
to ensure compliance with the new
regulation.

To fulfil that goal, a special Passenger
Competence Centre (PCC) was established in 2010 to ensure a customer-centric approach to our passenger business.
The aim is to align passenger services
standards between markets, making
sure that all activities and services, including marketing and communications,
meet DFDS’ standards ensuring a good
passenger experience before, during and
after travelling with DFDS.
Customer surveys and customer
service projects
Over the years, strong insights into
our customers’ expectations have
been developed through ongoing and
comprehensive Customer Satisfaction
Surveys (CSS), and the more recent
addition of DFDS’ Customer Focus Initiative. Through these surveys, we ask
approximately 20,000 passengers each
year about their opinion to gain a deep
understanding of our customers’ needs.
These insights serve as a basis for
continuous improvement of day-to-day
operations and services on board. The

Passenger rights
DFDS follows the European Maritime Passenger Rights Regulations
(1177/2010) that were put in place in
December 2012. In accordance with the
regulation, DFDS ensures that assistance is offered to disabled passengers
and to those with reduced mobility.
From booking to port facilities and,
ultimately, their voyage on board a DFDS
ship, passengers with special needs are
supported and informed every step of the
way. Other sections of the regulations
Our passengers

DFDS CR REPORT 2014

require that DFDS provides transparency
in pricing across countries and the entitlement of passengers to certain rights in
the event of delays or cancellations.
Communication with passengers
DFDS places a high priority on keeping
passengers informed throughout their
journey. Much of this communication
takes place directly at check-in and on
board the ships. However, a significant
and increasing proportion of information
is being transferred before and after the
journey via internet and social media.
For overnight routes, DFDS will seek to
inform passengers directly via SMS or
telephone calls in the event of major
disruption of services.
Our approach to social media is decentralised and country-specific and supported by an overarching DFDS social
media guideline that ensures consistency across markets.
Recognition
The DFDS approach towards meeting and
exceeding customer expectations has
been recognised with several awards.

TO DEVELOP
RESPONSIBLE
PROCUREMENT

Highlights
•	Annual sourcing of goods and services
for DKK 9bn, equal to 5,000 purchase
orders per month
•	All supply contracts include our Supplier Code of Conduct
Based on our Code of Conduct, all purchasing of goods and services is done
on an objective basis such as selecting
suppliers and products best fitted for
the purpose, price and quality, including delivery and payment terms.
As an objective way of choosing a
supplier, whilst still getting the best
conditions in favour of DFDS, we
started to embrace procurement tools
such as e-RFx and e-auctions in 2013.
In 2014, new suppliers of major items
such as classification society services,
marine paint, filters and lighting, were
chosen by means of these new tools.
The preparation process for e-auctions
and negotiations with other suppliers includes exploring new ways of
enhancing cooperation on procurement
with the business units in line with our
new procurement strategy, which was
finalised in 2013.
Next steps/commitment 2015/16
In 2015, DFDS is considering to join
the IMPA ACT, which is a complete
responsible supply chain management
programme. The programme has been
developed by Danish shipowners J.

Code of Conduct
Our suppliers must accept to conform
to the DFDS Supplier Code of Conduct
and all applicable international
conventions and national legislation
in the country where production or
services are performed. Specifically, our suppliers must respect the
following:
•	Laws relating to child labour,
coercion or involuntary labour
•	Rules regarding safety and the
workplace

Lauritzen and DS Norden, the leading
consultancy company GLOBAL CSR and
the International Marine Purchasing
Association (IMPA).
The IMPA ACT allows members to
access a common database with information regarding suppliers that have
already been through a vetting process
and are therefore considered to comply
with our Supplier Code of Conduct. As
many shipping companies share the
same suppliers, a standardised, joint
system, to ensure compliance throughout the industry, is expected to decrease
bureaucracy both for suppliers, who will
not have to spend time adhering to various codes of conducts, and for shipping

This will be a cost-effective approach
that will mitigate the resources needed
for monitoring and audits and provide
leverage for ensuring that suppliers
actually do make improvements in the
field of human rights including labour
rights, protection of the environment,
and anti-corruption issues.
The IMPA ACT builds on the UN Guiding
Principles and expectations are fully
aligned with the newest and strongest
developments within the field of CR.
