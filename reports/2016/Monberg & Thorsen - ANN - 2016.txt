Statutory CSR report

Monberg & Thorsen has positions on corporate social responsibility, but they do not comply with the requirements as defined in Section 99(a) of the Danish Financial Statements Act. Consequently, Monberg & Thorsen does not report specifically on its actions in this area or the results of these actions. The ethical policy sets the overall framework for all our activities. We want to demonstrate corporate responsibility, show consideration for people and the environment, thereby acting in a socially and ethically responsible manner in all business areas. The policy states, among other things, that we must comply with local legislation and that we do not accept bribery, forced labour, child labour or discrimination. Monberg & Thorsen is a holding company. Its sole activity is its ownership interest in MT Højgaard. For further details, reference is made to MT Højgaard’s annual report and MT Højgaard’s CSR report on their website www.mth.com. Women in management We do not discriminate on grounds of gender, race or religion when recruiting, training or promoting employees. At the same time, we want to promote the proportion of women in management at the MT Højgaard Group’s management levels. Consequently, a policy on women in management was introduced in the middle of 2013. At the same time, a target was set that, in 2016, at least two of the six externally elected members of MT Højgaard’s Board of Directors should be women. This target was met.
