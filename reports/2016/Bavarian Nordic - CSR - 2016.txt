CSR REPORT 2016

About the report
This Statutory Report on Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR), cf. sections 99a and 99b of the Danish
Financial Statements Act, is part of the Management
commentary in the 2016 Annual Report and covers
the financial period January 1 – December 31, 2016.

OUR SCIENCE
MAKES THE
GREATER IMPACT
LETTER FROM
THE CEO

2016 was perhaps the busiest year thus far
in our production. The transformation into a
multiproduct facility has completed and we
have manufactured a multitude of vaccines.

CSR REPORT 2016

We have leveraged the know-how
and expertise derived from many
years of experience in manufacturing
IMVAMUNE smallpox vaccine, to
expand our facility to produce other
commercial vaccines as well as
vaccines for clinical trials to support
the advancement of our pipeline.
IMVAMUNE remains a core asset
which we continue to supply to
the U.S. Government. Importantly,
we are preparing for commercial
manufacturing of our prostate cancer
vaccine, PROSTVAC for a successful
product launch, if approved.
In that light, it is very satisfying that,
of all the years we have reported on
our CO2 emissions, 2016 was the least
impactful – both in actual numbers and
relatively. While it could be expected
that our increased activity would entail
higher emissions, the result is very
satisfying, and gives evidence of our
ability to improve the efficiency in our
manufacturing process.

CSR REPORT 2016

It is our
mission
to make
significant
contributions
to improve
public
health

2016 was also a year with significant
investments in our pipeline. We continue to move forward our prioritized
projects; CV301, an immunotherapy
for lung cancer, and MVA-BN RSV for
protection against respiratory syncytial
virus, which both represent significant
opportunities in areas of high unmet
medical need. And with our partners
we continue to progress our other
product candidates in cancer and infectious diseases.
Albeit we continue to grow and mature our company, we are still a small
organization with an agile mindset
that allows us to adapt quickly to
changes. We had a slight increase in
our workforce in 2016, particularly in
our production as result of increased
activity. And we decided to close our
operations in California to relocate to
the U.S. east coast during first half of
2017. This will bring us closer to our
partners, collaborators and influencers
in the U.S., but not least also closer
to our headquarters and operations
in Europe, thus creating a stronger
connection between our people.

Being a company in growth, we are
not able to make pledges for lowering
our overall emissions. The activity level
in production in 2017 will be similar
to 2016; however, we will continue
our efforts to minimize our climate
impact over time. Having said that, our
impact is still modest and reasonable,
considering our mission to make
significant contributions to improve
the public health. We are striving
every day to make new discoveries
and develop novel therapies that could
help to protect or sustain people’s
lives. With that in mind, we believe
our science makes the greater impact.

HOW WE WORK WITH CSR
Once a biotech company mostly focused on R&D, now a fully integrated
vaccine manufacturer. The story of Bavarian Nordic goes back more than
20 years, and demonstrates the success of transforming science, innovation
and technology into a sustainable business, focused on the development,
manufacturing and commercialization of vaccines for the prevention of
life-threatening infectious diseases and the treatment of cancer.

The real transformation though
has taken place over just the last
few years where we have built our
manufacturing facility, capable of
producing millions of vaccines that
could potentially help protect and
save people’s lives, thus contributing
to a healthier and safer society.
That is a worthy mission.
And while pursuing our strategy and
objectives to remain sustainable and
grow our business further through
continued investments in research and
development, we recognize the importance of protecting the world around
us. This commands us to work and act
responsibly in all matters, and we aim
to do this by:
CSR REPORT 2016

•	 manufacturing high-quality vaccines.
•	 working actively and systematically
to minimize our impact on the
environment and climate.
•	 maintaining an active dialog with
our stakeholders on a local, national
and global level.
•	 actively supporting and respecting
human rights and labor standards.
•	 providing a safe and healthy
working environment for our
staff that includes opportunities
for professional and personal
development.
•	 communicating our CSR policy to
external collaboration partners,
including our suppliers.
•	 conducting business according to
highest ethical standards.

These are our guiding principles for
working with CSR, upon which we
have formulated our policies which
are further specified in relevant areas
throughout this report.
Reporting framework
Since the establishment of our production facility in Kvistgaard, Denmark in
2005, we have been subject to annual
environmental reporting to the Danish
authorities, and this has served as a
framework for key areas of our sustainability reporting. In addition, we draw
from the most pertinent elements of
some of the most widely known CSR reporting frameworks globally, notably the
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the
United Nations Global Compact (UNGC).

CSR organization
To ensure that our CSR initiatives are
carried out timely and efficiently
and to improve transparency on the
activities, we have established a CSR
steering committee comprised of
senior representatives in the Company,
in addition to a CSR working group
comprised of representatives from
human resources, investor relations &
communications and our environmental, health and safety specialist.

HOW WE WORK WITH CSR – continued

Scope of our reporting
In order to always focus on business
relevance, we selected the areas to
be reported based on a principle of
materiality: we endeavored to include
the most important ways in which
our company has either a direct or an
indirect impact on the world around us.
Our manufacturing facility in Kvistgaard,
Denmark, where also our headquarters
are located, is one of the chief sources
of our environmental impact, and we
seek to provide a high degree of transparency by calculating our CO2-emissions and reporting additional environmental data from this site.
Furthermore it represents almost two
thirds of our employees. In addition, we
have included our research and development facilities in Germany and the
USA, which represent the last third of
employees and contribute to our global
emissions by approximately 25%.

ENVIRONMENT AND
CLIMATE IMPACT

Our primary impact on the environment and climate is derived from our
vaccine production in Kvistgaard, Denmark, and we endeavor to reduce our
environmental and climate impact by
improving our manufacturing efficiency and processes in order to optimize
energy consumption and to minimize
emissions and waste.
We wish to be at the forefront of
environmental work and we seek to
be so by maintaining a high degree of
compliance and systematization in our

organization, driven by our environment, health and safety specialist who
proactively works to ensure that we
comply with environmental protection
regulations and relevant requirements
as defined by the authorities. In
general, we consider informal visits
by the authority as a benefit for
information sharing and joint risk perception as we may become aware of
issues that we did not consider before.
We furthermore encourage environmentally aware behavior throughout
the Company as a whole.

Non-financial key figures,
environment and climate
The presented key figures relate to our production
facility in Kvistgaard, Denmark, which also comprises

our headquarters with administrative functions
and quality laboratories. However, we also present
our global emissions, which include all other
company-owned or controlled locations, except
for single-person offices.

ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE IMPACT – continued

2016 developments
Production activities were further
increased in 2016 as we reinitiated
production of smallpox vaccines
for the U.S. Government, but also
continued production of vaccines for
our increasing number of clinical trials
as well as continued our preparations
for commercial manufacturing of
PROSTVAC. Overall, we increased our
production output by 51% as measured
by batches compared to 2015.
We have continued to optimize the consumption of raw materials and additives
in the production, again reducing the
relative consumption on several para­
meters, compared to 2015. We remain
focused on avoiding any unnecessary
use of chemicals and additives, thereby
also seeking to minimize the amount
of waste requiring special treatment.
Based on the energy screening performed in 2015, additional
CSR REPORT 2016

energy-saving initiatives were implemented in our production during the
year. Notably, we have introduced
more energy-efficient light sources,
implemented natural ventilation in a
boiler room and replaced traditional
gas boilers with condensing boilers.
These and additional initiatives have
helped to contain our overall energy
consumption despite increased activity.
During the year, we initiated construction of a new cold storage facility at
the Kvistgaard site. The facility will be
taken into operation in 2017.
There were two, non-material breaches of the environmental terms at the
facility. One was a damaged filter from
a deactivation tank. It was assessed
to have no impact on the external
environment. The authorities were
informed and the procedure was
changed in order to ensure a future
lower burden on the filters. The second was a noise complaint related to

a temporary breakdown of a refrigeration compressor.

Results and targets
Emissions (note 1)
Despite increased manufacturing activities, our total C02 emissions were 13%
lower compared to 2015, and our relative climate impact from production
dropped by impressive 39%, reaching
the lowest level in both absolute and

relative terms since we started our
CSR reporting. These improvements
result from a better utilization of the
production facility, but also from our
ability to make further optimizations
of the manufacturing process. In 2017,
we expect a similar activity level in
production as in 2016 and thus do not
foresee emission reductions.
The chart shows the relative C02
emission from production per batch.

ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE IMPACT – continued

Energy (note 2)
Energy consumption increased by
14%, but the relative consumption
decreased by 25% compared to 2015.
While the facility has seen several
expansions over the years, resulting
in a higher base consumption of
electricity and heating, the variable
energy consumption largely depends
on the activity level in the production.
Therefore we have abandoned our
previous target, which was defined
as a relative number based on the
area of the facility (kWh per m2). We
will maintain a high focus on energyefficient solutions in all new projects.
Water (note 3)
Given the increased manufacturing
activities, reductions in the water
consumption were not possible in
2016. However, the relative consumption was lowered by 25% compared to
2015 due to better production efficiency. While we will continue to monitor

CSR REPORT 2016

for inappropriate consumption and
make corrective actions accordingly,
it is our assessment that the current
relative consumption likely cannot be
further lowered.
Waste (note 4)
The amount of waste was slightly
higher than compared to 2015, which
is largely attributed to higher manufacturing activity. However, as we
succeeded in implementing new procedures for separation and handling
of waste, we increased the share of
waste for recycling from 9% in 2015 to
43% in 2016. Importantly, the fraction
of waste requiring special treatment
was slightly reduced.

As the new waste handling procedures were only implemented during

not reach full effect, we expect to
further increase the share of waste
for recycling in 2017.

BUILT ON SCIENCE,
DRIVEN BY PEOPLE
Our employees are our most valuable
asset and as an innovative, knowledgebased company, it is important for us
to attract and retain highly qualified
workers. For this reason, we want to
offer our staff a good and inspiring
working environment that also provides
them with development opportunities.
Being a global organization, we support a diverse, accommodating and
non-discriminatory working environment where, regardless of gender,
age, ethnicity, physical impairment,
religion or sexual orientation, we all
aspire to the same objectives.
We strive to maintain a good work-life
balance, and we focus on employee
health, safety and job satisfaction. We
systematically map both the physical
and psychosocial working environment
so that the necessary preventive
steps can be taken, for the benefit of
both individual employees and the
Company as a whole. We do so in a
CSR REPORT 2016

close dialogue between management
and employees through a number
of established committees, including
local works councils and a health and
safety committee.
The overall objectives of our occupational health and safety policy are to
enable ourselves to control our occupational health and safety risks and
improve our occupational health and
safety performance in order to eliminate or minimize risks to personnel
and guests who could be exposed to
hazards associated with our activities.
To help achieve these objectives, we
have laid down the following principles:
•	 Risks that might lead to an occupational health injury or ill health have
to be assessed in order to determine
actions (risk mitigation) that can
reduce the impact or the likelihood
•	 Adverse incidents are evaluated
in order to learn and to consider if
changes of the working conditions or

the occupational health and safety
policy are warranted
•	 Education and training support the
members of the occupational health
and safety organization
•	 The organization is prepared to
respond to any emergency situations
and prevent or mitigate associated
adverse consequences

2016 developments
Our workforce increased by 7% in
2016, primarily as result of increased
activity at our Kvistgaard site where
we – as planned – conducted workplace assessments among all employees. The assessments focused on
both the physical and psychosocial
working environment and provided
important learnings to help mitigate
risks through identification of potential issues related to the safety and
well-being of our employees. Based
on the output from the assessments,
the local health and safety committee

will develop and implement action
plans during 2017.
A collective agreement was entered
with laboratory workers at the Kvistgaard site, where technicians and
production operators were already
covered by collective agreements.
We conducted a global leadership
training program. The vision of
the program was to empower the
organization through leadership
development and create a common
leadership foundation across the
organization.
We maintained an equal distribution
of men and women in managerial
positions with 48% and 52% respec­
tively. While we aim to maintain an
equal gender distribution among the
managers, they are selected on the
basis of their qualifications and not
on gender.

Results and targets
Occupational accidents (note 5)
We recorded just one occupational
accident in 2016, resulting in injuryrelated absence of only one day. This
translates into an accident frequency
rate of 1.3 accidents per million working hours compared to 8.2 in 2015,
and thus we met our reduction target.

The safety organization has continued
its focus on reporting and handling of
near-misses and observations, which
we believe has contributed to the
overall improvement in safety at our
manufacturing site. These preventative
efforts remain in focus and the safety
organization has set specific targets

target to maintain the rate below 4%.
At our Kvistgaard site we have previously implemented dialog-based absence management, which has proven
successful, and we expect to roll out
this and other management initiatives
at our other sites during 2017, aiming
to reduce illness-related absence.

PRODUCT
SAFETY

SUPPLIERS

Product safety is crucial in our business,
and quality and responsibility are important
elements of our corporate culture.

In accordance with both GMP and our own
supplier management system, we perform
a risk assessment of all new suppliers of
critical materials and equipment used in
our production and laboratories.

Vaccine development is a
highly regulated area, in which
a strong regulatory regime of
inspections and approvals sets
a high standard for all areas of
our disciplines.
We work according to Good
Manufacturing Practice (GMP),
which are rules laid down by
the European and U.S. health
authorities. GMP includes strict
requirements with respect to
a product’s traceability, quality
and purity, which means
that quality management is

CSR REPORT 2016

built into each step of the
manufacturing process.
To-date, we have produced and
delivered more than 30 million
vaccine doses. Even though
largely all these vaccines have
been stockpiled for emergency
use only, we and our partners
have conducted various clinical
trials of our product candidates
in more than 10,000 people,
demonstrating that our vaccine
platform technology has a
favorable safety profile.

Suppliers whose products are
considered to have a material
impact on our products’ quality
and safety, will undergo an
initial audit, followed by an
evaluation every third year
as a minimum, either by way
of a visit or a questionnaire,
depending on the situation. The
structured audit process helps
us to gauge the quality and
CSR mindset of our suppliers.
Through this close collaboration
with our key suppliers, we are
gaining a deep insight into

their business processes and
capabilities, which provides
important learnings for
optimizing our own processes.
Our suppliers of raw materials
are mainly located in North
America and the EU, which
are areas with a high level
of regulation of social and
environmental parameters
in place.

BUSINESS
ETHICS

HUMAN
RIGHTS

Bavarian Nordic prioritizes business
ethics as a natural part of its underlying
business concept.

We support and respect human rights.
Our compliance in this area is widely covered
by our health and safety policies as well
as observance of the national labor laws in
the countries in which we operate.

We want to be seen as
credible and reliable by all
our stakeholders, and we are
committed to work actively
against corruption in all
its forms.
Our Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics (“the
Code”) describes the
ethical requirements for all
employees’ and the Board of
Directors’ behavior in relation
to customers, employees,
shareholders, society, suppliers
and partners. The Code includes
the rules and regulations in
the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (FCPA) and the Truth in
Negotiations Act (TINA) that
are relevant in connection
CSR REPORT 2016

with the Company's business
transactions and negotiations in
the United States, but equally
relevant in other markets,
where the Company operates.
All employees receive yearly
training in the Code, and new
employees will receive training
as part of their introductory
program. Thus the observation
of the Code rests upon all
employees and all employees
are encouraged to report issues,
concerns and any breach of
the Code. For this purpose, the
Company has established a
whistleblower system, which
provides our employees with
an opportunity file reports in a
secure and confidential manner.

While the scope of these efforts
is mainly directed towards our
own employees, we seek to
conduct our business with third
parties in compliance with the
principles as well. In 2015, we
performed a screening to assess
how our business may impact
human rights, and it indicated
no actual adverse impacts. We
will continue to monitor for
potential adverse impacts, in
order to determine if additional
actions are required.

As part of our procurement
policies, we perform regular
audits of our suppliers,
whom we encourage to act
responsibly in all matters
relating to CSR, including
observing international human
rights. Also, we conduct our
clinical trials in a manner that
recognizes the importance
of protecting the safety of
and respecting the research
participants. We do this by
applying the highest legal,
ethical and scientific standards,
in addition to complying with
applicable laws and regulations.

Process wastewater is heat-inactivated, cooled
and pH adjusted before being discharged into the
public sewer system. Inactivation is a procedure that
ensures that all virus remnants are rendered 100%
harmless, and the system is checked for operational
problems before discharge. This treatment ensures
that the discharged wastewater complies with the
requirements in the Company's permit to use the
municipal sewer system.

CSR REPORT 2016

Reporting practice
Water consumption is measured for the entire
Kvistgaard facility, including laboratories and
administrative functions.
The fractions of phosphorous, nitrogen,
carbon and chlorides in the waste water are
based on a single analysis which is conducted
once a year.
