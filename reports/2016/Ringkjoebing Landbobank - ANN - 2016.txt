corporate social responsibility
Statement on corporate social responsibility
Ringkjøbing Landbobank wants to be a responsible and value-creating bank, and works
to create the best results for its shareholders, customers and employees, the local
communities, the surrounding environment and finally the bank itself as a financial
institution.
It is also the bank’s overall goal to be seen as a solid and attentive partner among all its
stakeholders.
On the basis of this goal and the bank’s deep roots in the local communities in which
the bank is represented, the board of directors has prepared and adopted a corporate
social responsibility (CSR) policy. The bank’s CSR policy is divided to focus specifically
on the four stakeholder groups: customers, employees, the environment and the local
community.
The bank’s CSR policy is available on the bank’s website at the address:
www.landbobanken.dk/csr. In accordance with Section 135 of the executive order on
financial reports for credit institutions and investment companies etc., the statutory
complete statement on corporate social responsibility is available at the same address.
Further to the above, please note that the bank has not prepared specific policies on
human rights or climate. The bank supports the efforts to put human rights and the
climate high on the agenda but, as a local and regional bank, has not currently found it
necessary to develop separate policies for these areas.
