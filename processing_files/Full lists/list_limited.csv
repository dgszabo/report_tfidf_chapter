2,Alk-Abello,ANN,2009,management s review 15 alk s corporate social responsibility csr alk s mission is to improve quality of life by developing pharmaceuticals that treat the actual cause of allergy instead of just relieving symptoms this is considered a responsible way of managing allergic diseases from patient and society perspectives not least because allergy vaccination potentially prevents the development of additional allergies and asthma in alk s products and product development nature s own allergen compounds are used as raw materials pollen from grasses and trees insect venoms house dust mites etc are cultivated purified and further processed into active ingredients for allergy vaccines these vaccines are then used by patients to re-programme their immune system and rebuild tolerance making it possible to enjoy nature and withstand the natural exposure to those same substances the amounts of biological and chemical materials used in the production of allergy vaccines are very small thus affecting the environment at a very low scale compared to most industries the gradual paradigm shift in physicians general treatment of allergy away from short-range symptomatic treatment towards using allergy vaccines to treat the actual cause of allergy is however creating sustained growth in the production of alk s allergy vaccines as a growth company alk recognizes the

management s review in the annual report for and covers the financial period 1 january to 31 december reinforcement of wind turbine foundation the arkil group carries out construction work including asphalt production based on departments in denmark germany and ireland as well as production of inpipe liners in sweden the group wishes to expand its business in a way which is both socially and financially sustainable apart from complying with legislation on all the plants it is also the group s policy to live up to ethical codex in respect of both environmental and work related conditions and avoid corruption the work in respect of corporate social responsibility is deeply rooted in the arkil group s values and is a natural part of the organisation s behaviour towards the outside world the arkil group s codex of business principles is available on arkil s website www.arkil.dk environmental conditions in the arkil group has continued to focus on environmental impacts arkil regards environmental conditions in a broad perspective and this covers 26 arkil holding directors report for both the external and internal environment including working environment environmental conditions are thus viewed broadly and are always part of the projects carried out in the departments and companies included in the group in the building and construction industry showed increased awareness and focus on working environment this trend will also prevail in the years to come it is therefore important to maintain constant focus on a safe environment in the company the departments in the asphalt division are certified in accordance with the quality standard iso 9001 the environmental standard iso 14001 the working environment standard ohsas 18001 in addition all our asphalt products have been ce marked in accordance with ds/en 13108 in november the asphalt division was recertified in accordance with the 3 iso standards the management system is described in a handbook covering the 3 iso standards as well as the standard ds/en 13108 safety arkil s safety policy is our pledge to bring down the number of work accidents through an active and targeted effort to the group s goal of zero work accidents and zero absences due to work accidents safety representatives were elected in 38 safety representatives have been elected for the period 2009-2011 re-elections have taken place and new people have been elected it has not been difficult to find candidates which proves that there is a sound interest in the working environment within arkil in the establishment of local health and safety committees was a significant and important task in all sections accordingly 15 local health and safety committees have now been established the incentive for this changed structure of the safety work is to place more emphasis on the working environment in the divisions the local conditions applying are best known within the individual departments and thus the departments are best suited to come up with solutions to specific questions regarding working environment that arise in the departments a significant task for the local health and safety committees is to investigate the causes of work accidents and assess the risks of existing and new work processes implementation of work place 27 assessment as well as assistance concerning guidance and training instruction is also important working areas for the local health and safety committees executive and unifying for these health and safety committees is the main health and safety committee with representatives from all sections of the company the main health and safety committee s task is to coordinate work on the working environment the main health and safety committee handles questions regarding the working environment which is of general importance to all sections this takes place through information campaigns and inspections thus it is encouraging to see that the accident frequency dropped from 26 in to 22 in this is a trend which we hope will continue in the years to come with increased focus on the working environment partly from the newly established local health and safety committees as well as a general raising of the awareness of the company s working environment the accident frequency is expected to be in line with industry average the number of work accidents in was 42 with a total of 946 absence days unfortunately we have seen an increase in the frequency of absence due to accidents in the number was 2.3 absence hours for every 1,000 work hours but in the number was 3.7 absence hours for every 1,000 work hours this is the highest level in several years an explanation in the increase in the frequency of absence due to accidents is that out of the 42 work accidents 7 alone account for 699 absence days or almost 75 of the absence it is mainly back injuries and fractures that causes the long periods of absence both the main health and safety committee as well as the local health and safety committees are aware of the nature of these accidents without doubt the goal still remains zero work accidents and zero absence days increased focus on preventive actions and strengthening of safety work in the departments are the means to achieving this goal again in safety related courses were held more specifically training in occupational health and the courses vejen

s strategies with this in mind the company keeps focusing on the importance of training and education an area which still remains of high priority so that the company can deliver on the demands from its clients and customers in the course of the last four years arkil has targeted its efforts on apprentices the goal is to educate more and educate better they have succeeded in both as the company through the last four years has doubled the number of apprentices by the end of arkil employed 50 construction and paving apprentices as well as 13 apprentices within the fields of road building equipment driving road paving vehicle driving construction plant mechanics and office work this means that at this point approximately one in ten of the employees in the apprentice training departments is an apprentice the apprentice policy at arkil is evaluated on a regular basis in order to keep improving the policy the improvements mean that arkil can improve the environment for the company s apprentices and ensure that they will achieve the optimal benefit from their apprenticeship in the company a large part of the people who completed their training continue to work in arkil and arkil keeps a goal of increasing the number of skilled workers in the company in addition to a targeted effort on apprentices arkil also focuses on the importance of education/training of hourly workers and non-manual workers and managers so that the company at all times has the right employees with the right skills and qualifications who will be able to carry out the work and projects of the company this is achieved through the continued development of the arkil academy which for a number of years has trained the company s non-manual employees and managers in fields such as strategy finance management and day-to-day operations one of the new features at the arkil academy is an executive programme which focuses on project management allowing the executives of the company to enhance qualifications and improve their ability to resolve corporate tasks simultaneously with the internal training programme at the arkil academy the company staff both hourly workers and salaried employees receive training via external courses to make sure they possess the required qualifications arkil holding management report for on top of that arkil continues to focus on completion and updating of compulsory courses as the company will not compromise with applicable legislation and safety another training project that the company has been involved in for a number of years is the asphalt school the asphalt school is a project created in cooperation with the trade union 3f the danish asphalt pavement association and the adult education centres of vuc the asphalt school focuses on the importance of general skills such as maths and danish in qualifying the company s employees to meet the requirements of the future project asphalt school has been offered to all hourly paid employees in arkil s asphalt division many have accepted the offer to improve the individual qualifications in these areas so the company has decided to extend the collaboration to develop the asphalt school and is currently looking at the possibility of offering elearning at 9th and 10th danish grade level and that is not the only area in which arkil has chosen to offer elearning to the employees it is a form of education that helps create greater flexibility since it enables the employee to acquire new knowledge and qualifications when it is convenient for the employee as well as for the compan focus on environmental conditions in the arkil group environmental conditions are regarded in a broad perspective and this covers both the external environment and the working environment environmental conditions are thus viewed broadly and are always part of the projects carried out in the departments and companies included in the group the group s environmental and climate policies aim at a continued improvement of our environmental performance within the technically and financially possible limits arkil s asphalt activities are certified in accordance with the quality standard iso 9001 the environmental standard iso 14001 and the working environment standard ohsas 18001 in addition all our asphalt products have been ce marked in accordance with ds/en 13108 the environmental management system is described in a manual covering the 3 iso standards as well as the product standard ds/en 13108 arkil s other divisions have developed their own environmental management systems based on the knowledge and experience of the asphalt division arkil has focus on increased reuse of raw materials and reduction of the energy consumption in the production process to the benefit of the environment thus recycling plants have been established at all the group s wholly owned asphalt plants in denmark and germany with an average production of minimum 40,000 tonnes a year increased use of recycled materials in the production helps reducing the consumption of scarce resources in the form of oil products stone materials etc the application rate for the use of recycled materials in the products is to some extent determined by the product programme for the tenders awarded as well as by the clients product specifications investment in better warehouse facilities at the asphalt plants is made on an on-going basis these being in the form of covered storage spaces for storing recycled materials and raw materials for the asphalt production so that the materials can be kept dry the use of dry materials in production contributes to significant reductions in the energy consumption arkil keeps focusing on initiatives and matters which can contribute to reducing the total environmental impact by minimising fuel consumption when replacing or purchasing machinery energy consumption should be considered as a key parameter when selecting machinery brand a part of the production planning for construction projects is the focus on optimisation of the energy consumption furthermore there is great focus on the driving patterns of the machine operators since considerable savings can be achieved when applying an optimal driving pattern the effort for a better environment and larger sustainability takes place on an on-going basis in relation to customers production and services in connection with product development as well as in relation to the group s own direct external impact on the environment and the climate the overall result of the activities carried out has not been accounted for as reliable measurements can not be made of this 24 arkil holding management report for focus on working environment in accordance with arkil s working environment policy no employee in the company arkil a/s shall be exposed to larger risks than can be justified when using our best insight and knowledge the company s employees should be able to expect that even after years of employment they would not be more run-down or burdened by effects of the working environment than what is caused by natural ageing this puts the company under an obligation to prevent work accidents and work-related ill-health by ensuring that the employees are properly trained and instructed in how to carry out their work and that the conditions are right for carrying out their tasks work accidents must be avoided one of the ways being to promote a culture which focuses on the safety and health of the employees our employees must stay alert and raise questions if conditions which are not satisfactory are discovered the working environment is also the personal responsibility of each employee our asphalt activities have been certified according to ds/ohsas 18001 as regards the work environment the activity is audited internally and externally several times a year on this matter in arkil set out a goal of an average accident frequency of max

report for absence frequency rose by 142 in in average there were 1.9 absence hours for every 1,000 work hours in compared to 4.6 absence hours for every 1,000 work hours in this rise can be attributed to a couple of employees being long-term absent due to illness the trends in accident frequency and absence due to accidents the last 5 years can be seen in the charts below in we have worked systematically to prevent work accidents with initiatives such as recording near misses and designing preventive measures by the end of the year 49 near misses had been recorded this number is significantly lower than expected the reports have resulted in action which in the long term will help improve safety across the organization reporting near misses is an important element of the effort to prevent work accidents as well as creating and maintaining a positive culture of safety that is why this is one of our goals for with regard to increasing safety through knowledge the health and safety department introduced 2 different newsletters in which will be sent to all employees 2-4 times annually 1 newsletter on quality environment and working environment focus on new initiatives new legislation regulations etc with consequences for employees on our sites 2 newsletter on near misses based on the most recent records of near misses everyone is informed of selected observations

company policy not to discriminate based on gender when hiring or appointing individuals to any type of position in the group the company recognizes that it operates in an industry in which production at times involves hard physical labour which contributes to an overrepresentation of men in production due to the limited number of female applicants in administration the situation is reversed and a similar overrepresentation of women among the applicants and consequently in the actual positions can be observed when appointing or hiring employees to management positions including executives and other management positions that involve staff and professional responsibility it is essential to the best interest of the company that the selection criterion be best suited for the position meaning in possession of insight experience and understanding of the job in question and based on previous performance and results whether the candidates for the position be internal or external men or women the gender distribution in management positions within a particular business area will likely reflect the gender distribution among the employees of that business area which in turn is a reflection of the gender distribution among the applicants for all the positions of that business area to achieve a better gender balance in the actual jobs then we first need a better gender balance among the applicants for those jobs nevertheless it is the company s objective to achieve to the extent possible a gender-balanced distribution on the board of directors and in the company s other management levels based on the above as well as on section 139a of the danish companies act the company has drawn up a gender and diversity policy to seek a more balanced distribution in the company s management levels in accordance with the practise of the danish business authority the company has an equal distribution of women and men on its current board of directors the gender and diversity policy

through among other things follow-up and feedback the evaluation from shows that in the apprentices were very satisfied with their training programme and they explain that the quality of the labour that was provided is increasing in 16 apprentices finished their training at arkil eleven of them passed their apprenticeship tests with praise or a medal which shows that the structured training efforts and mentor programme that arkil offers result in skilled apprentices all this contributes to the reasons why a large number of the apprentices continue working at arkil after completing their

technological progress and specific human efforts efforts to protect the environment and create greater sustainability in production take place in continuous collaboration internally within the organisation and with customers and consultants and in connection with production and services arkil 's other divisions have based on the knowledge and experience of the asphalt division developed their own environmental management systems activities in in arkil focused on the reuse of raw materials and reduction in energy consumption across all branches of the production process major initiatives include an extensive renewal and renovation of the asphalt plant in skrydstrup which means that the plant now complies with all applicable environmental regulations the eu energy efficiency directive eed from lists a number of binding measures for member states with regard to achieving the eu savings target of 20 by 2020 this means among other things that member states are obliged to ensure that large companies carry out energy audits to identify opportunities and reduce energy consumption arkil falls within the large company category measured both in terms of finances and in terms of number of employees and the statutory energy audit was therefore conducted in arkil therefore complies with the requirements set down in the eu energy efficiency directive eed and statutory instrument 1212 the purpose of the energy audit is to carry out an assessment of energy consumption at arkil a/s and identify energy-saving measures that can be implemented for the purpose of reducing energy consumption in the company where relevant the conclusions and recommendations set out in the energy audit report form to the extent possible the basis for the environmental objectives objectives the company continuously works on conditions and initiatives that can reduce the overall environmental impact and reduce fuel consumption when we acquire new materials 24 annual report energy consumption is included as a key parameter during selection in denmark arkil has access to more than 450 vehicles of up to 3,500 kg with a high average age resulting in major operating costs including high fuel consumption in order to resolve the issues relating to for example operating costs a new car policy has been implemented to ensure better finances and transparent operations among other things the car policy will include the introduction of a number of `` standard cars '' for which the replacement period will be six years going forward all cars will be leased and linked to a full service agreement for the duration of this period instructions are also being prepared for users of the cars to manage issues relating to unnecessary use and wear and tear 70 new vans have been ordered so far the aim is also to train our excavator operators in the correct use of the excavator operating modes it is crucial both with regard to carbon emission load and operating finances that material is used correctly and excavator operators therefore need to be trained in energy-efficient operations during at the same time there will be an increased focus on whether the ideal excavator is being used for each individual task there is an assumption that excavators that are too large or too small are sometimes used resulting in inappropriate operating costs increased distribution and use of logging equipment in excavators will serve as an indicator of the effect of the measures arkil works continuously on the options to optimise the reduction of energy consumption in processes at asphalt plants including ongoing development of recipes we will also regularly assess whether it is possible to recover heat from flue gas in we will also initiate a process to cover raw materials in certain locations here we also anticipate notable energy savings at asphalt plants working environment and working conditions the overall purpose of arkil 's working environment policy is to reduce the number of occupational accidents and ensure that no-one is exposed to unnecessary risk at work the working environment has top priority at arkil partly through a series of educational programmes and increased focus on follow-up and prevention work arkil has a clear objective of being one of the safest employers in the construction industry this means that the accident rate must be reduced and the number of days of absence due to accidents must also be reduced in order to achieve this ob- jective a number of activities have been initiated that together will help promote a good working environment across the entire organisation activities in risk assessments are generally carried out for all contracts and the risk assessment will form the basis for the start-up meetings in several turnkey contracts arkil has volunteered for the coordinator role ensuring that experiences can be shared across the organisation several working environment coordinators have been trained in connection with this the statutory working environment training has been established in collaboration with an external working environment consultant and arkil ensuring that the training material uses arkil as its basis this results in a greater understanding of the subjects that are being taught and ensures direct usability of documents e-learning has been developed and introduced across arkil e-learning material has been developed the e-learning deals with safety and the working environment and consists of a 25-minute film different training material to ensure that the recipient gains an understanding of and insight into the subject a number of validation questions to ensure that the recipient has understood the message all employees must complete the e-learning and new employees will complete the e-learning within the first 14 days of employment each manager is responsible for ensuring that their employees complete the e-learning new folders have also been created and these are considered a useful tool for the communication of health and safety-related material folder for subcontractors and partners concerning health and safety at arkil instructions for machine operators safety and working environment e-learning 80 new working environment representatives and working environment managers were also elected across the organisation in the working environment committee is a crucial forum for ensuring development prevention investigation and corrective action relating to the working environment at arkil management report 25 near-accidents reporting of near-accidents is considered a key instrument in the prevention of accidents and targets have therefore been established with regard to near-accident reporting in many more near-accidents were reported than the previous year and communication relating to near-accidents will continue the working environment department will follow up on reported near-accidents and strives to provide feedback to the reporter within 14 days if the report results in changes to procedures or the ways in which the work is carried out occupational accidents and accident rates the number of reportable occupational accidents in denmark in was 34 corresponding to an accident rate of 14 the target of reducing the number of occupational accidents by 30 has therefore been achieved the accident rate has steadily decreased for a number of years through awareness and targeted efforts across the entire organisation in the accident rate was 17.1 a system has been developed for the purpose of focusing on learning from accidents for those accidents where management finds that more people would benefit from learning special memorandums will be created for use as instructions objectives in the working environment organisation will continue to focus on further reduction of the accident rate and absence due to accidents based on the activities described the target is to reduce the accident rate from the current 14 in to 13 in the psychological working environment will also be in focus especially the limitation and reduction of stress among arkil employees developments in absence due to sick leave are closely monitored by arkil and are given high priority in absence due to illness was 4.4 compared to 3.9 in the absence rate has fallen from 3.7 hours of absence per 1,000 working hours in to 1.7

in order to continually attract an adequate number of apprentices an apprenticeship campaign was initiated in the aim was to improve the number of apprenticeship applications using a campaign that was communicated partly via the website www.arkil-elev.dk and partly via a specific facebook profile where current apprentices post about their everyday experiences on an arkil apprenticeship the results of the campaign could be seen in arkil previously received occasional apprenticeship applications in arkil received 174 applications for the apprenticeships due to commence at the start of the strategy of allowing the current apprentices to act as ambassadors for arkil apprenticeships was therefore a success this success also resulted in the danish minister of education visiting arkil in where she learned about the apprenticeship initiative and met two of the apprentices nick johansen and patrick christiansen 3f also paid a visit to arkil in to learn more about the initiatives in the area of apprenticeships greater priority for the hr area one of the goals for was to give greater priority to the hr area this was achieved through organisational changes that have resulted in increased focus on the area activities and results in arkil 's international companies like the danish departments arkil 's international companies in germany ireland and sweden have an ongoing focus on employee education in germany particular efforts were made in to target the individual courses and educational programmes to suit the needs of the individual employees after the course each employee must complete an evaluation form that is subsequently analysed by management the employee's feedback is thereby included as an important part of the overall evaluation of the educational initiatives 10 csr report quired to quickly and efficiently find their place in their new workplace the hr department has also initiated a recruitment analysis that will identify purely geographically where there is insufficient manpower in arkil and how to attract this specific workforce the recruitment analysis remains a point of focus and will continue into at the same time we will launch an initiative to ensure job satisfaction during this is in continuation of the initiatives used in with the aim of reducing absence the initiatives have included meetings with employees who are on sick leave in collaboration with their immediate manager in close collaboration with arkil 's health safety department hr will have a focus on proactive education of managers with regard to both the physical and the psychological working environment in education and further education will continue to have a high priority in just as in previous years in order to ensure continued high levels of education for apprentices we will implement a satisfaction survey among apprentices in our impression is that the mentor scheme that is the mainstay of arkil 's education of apprentices is working well but we would also like the apprentices evaluation of this not least because we know that mentors are crucial to ensuring a successful apprenticeship period targeted management training for middle managers will also continue in a group of arkil employees completed further education in `` management in practice '' and '' project management '' during january these courses contribute to building a common management culture across arkil and the targeted management training will therefore continue in goals for arkil 's international companies in educational initiatives will continue to have great importance in the international companies in in germany the goal for is to better equip employees to comply with internal and external requirements and guidelines this will take place through the internal education of multiple employee groups across all levels of the organisation csr report 11 working environment and working conditions health safety policy n o arkil group employee is to be exposed to greater risk than is justified by the best possible insight and knowledge company employees must be able to expect even after many years of employment to not be subject to more wear and tear or more negatively affected by the work environment than would result from ordinary aging ÔÅÆ we comply with applicable health safety regulations and requirements relevant to the company's activities ÔÅÆ we minimise the health safety risks for each individual through the correct expertise instructions and aids ÔÅÆ we communicate effectively and reciprocally with our employees and stakeholders concerning health safety issues to ensure that the health safety policy and objectives are clear to everyone ÔÅÆ we strive to ensure that arkil 's subcontractors and suppliers comply with the company 's health safety policy ÔÅÆ assessment of health safety risks must take place throughout the entire business chain from tendering to planning and implementation through to the conclusion of a project this also applies to the procurement of machinery and services ÔÅÆ we strive for continued improvement of health safety in the company in order to achieve a healthier work culture working environment and working conditions at arkil including risks since the employees are arkil 's most important asset and essential to the company 's success and results the most substantial risks are naturally linked to employee conditions the overall purpose of arkil 's working environment policy is to reduce the number of occupational accidents and ensure that no-one is exposed to unnecessary risks at work the health safety policy is converted to action through 2-year objectives supported by specific action plans the action plans are adjusted annually so as to best support the overall objectives this structured approach and a prioritised health safety organisation have ensured great improvements in the area over the last four years 12 csr report activities and achievements in based on the evaluations the health safety department one of the primary objectives for was to reduce the day will be selected based on the requests from the main has found that the health safety day was a major suc- accident rate from 14 in down to 13 at the end of we were happy to confirm that the goal for the year had been met this is the fifth year running in which we have succeeded in reducing the accident rate we were also delighted when arkil asphalt received the `` √•rets arbejdsmilj√∏pris '' health safety award from the asphalt industry in march the award is presented annually to the company with the fewest occupational accidents and which also has an increased focus on `` near-accidents '' and learning from these these excellent results show that the ongoing initiative to reduce occupational accidents is paying for itself cess and has decided to repeat it in the theme of the health safety committee organisation of health safety weeks two annual health safety weeks were introduced in as a new initiative the health safety weeks will be included as fixed campaign initiatives in coming years for the purpose of involving all arkil employees in the creation of a safe and healthy working environment the themes for the weeks will be determined by arkil 's main health safety committee and the themes for were `` safety rounds '' and `` near-accidents '' continuing education for health safety representatives learning from occupational accidents arkil 's health safety department has an ongoing focus on arkil focuses on learning from the incident and prevention to ensure that occupational accidents are not repeated the health safety representatives there is considerable scope to improve their roles including through continuing education and creating recognition of their function all occupational injuries must therefore be analysed and an '' analysis and learning for action '' will be prepared based on the analysis this will be communicated to all employees

on new employee 10 inductions as the statistics show that 37 of all occupational accidents affect hourly paid employees with a length of service of less than one year with arkil in connection with this the plan is that work procedures will 0 be standardised to ensure learning from previous undesired accidents per 1 million working hours incidents thereby ensuring that employees are instructed

group tor/equalopportunityanddiversitypolicy the company 's policy is to address gender imbalance in the within various positions by actively encouraging qualified arkil group applicants of the underrepresented gender to apply for advertised positions and thus over time reducing the imbalance the company keeps statistics on the gender distribution between applicants for advertised positions and gender distribution among staff to ensure within reasonable tolerances that there is a correlation between the gender distribution of applicants for a business area and the gender distribution among employees including management positions the company strives to invite an equal number of male and female applicants to interviews provided that the advertised qualification requirements have been met by applicants of both genders the company wishes to ensure that all employees regardless of gender have equal opportunities to pursue a career in the company activities and achievements in in arkil filled eight vacant management positions the positions were filled by one female candidate and seven male candidates following a structured process that included arkil 's equal opportunities and diversity policy for the board of directors a target of 40 has been set for the proportion of elected female board members a target that has been achieved as 2 out of 5 board members are women agnete raaschou-nielsen and birgitte nielsen are acting as the chairman and deputy chairman respectively of the board of arkil holdings no targets have been set for the gender composition of corporate management currently comprising three men or of the other management levels within the arkil group was also the year in which arkil put part of its corporate social responsibility for integrating

achievements in the new law on tenders that took effect in gave rise to a number of internal courses being held at arkil all managing employees and employees who work on the submission of tenders and

bang olufsen continually strives to minimise environmental impact and achieve a balance between such impact and our products qualities economic viability lifetime and aesthetics our wish is to be among the best in the industry also within the environmental area we wish to communicate openly about environmental issues and publish an annual environmental statement we comply of course with current legislation at all times we wish to contribute to globally sustainable development and assess our activities from a life cycle perspective which involves several phases development concept design and construction in this creative process the product s environmental properties are determined the aim is to reduce environmental impact during the subsequent life cycle phases raw materials our choice of materials aims at avoiding materials that can give rise to environmental issues production in our choice of production methods and production equipment cleaner technologies have high priority we prioritise the near environment and the creation of a safe and healthy working environment for our employees our objective is to improve the physical as well as the psychological working environment when selecting suppliers we ensure that they have an appropriate attitude towards the environment and act accordingly we wish to maintain a continuing dialogue with each individual supplier to create the right environmental conditions for the part of the product s life cycle for which the supplier is responsible transport we make environmental demands on our transport operators in terms of a high degree of utilisation and optimum application of technology for the transport units application our aim is for our products to be enjoyed problemfree in the customer s home environment that the products have an extended life and a low energy consumption disposal our aim is to provide product parts that are suitable for recycling and that major parts can be identified when dismantled in order to ensure appropriate disposal and recycling environmental issues the bang olufsen logo is a guarantee of quality we want our customers to buy bang olufsen products in the knowledge that we have made intelligent decisions on their behalf also in respect of environmental issues based on life cycle analysis of our products we know that the biggest environmental impact from bang olufsen s products is energy consumption while in use consequently it has been obvious for us to focus our efforts on reducing stand-by consumption since this is often regarded as a pure waste of energy bang olufsen is to a great extent at the cutting edge of the latest eup directive1 packaging is yet another focus area while the purpose of packaging is to protect the product during handling storage and transport it is however often seen as a waste of resources as well as a disposal problem we employ materials that can be re-used after disposal packaging for the majority of our products consists of cardboard boxes where the product is secured by two shells of expanded polystyrene eps both cardboard and eps can be recycled or incinerated after use legislatively the area is covered by the eu s packaging directive2 which prescribes minimising packaging in october beocenter 6-26 won the scandinavian packaging award scanstar given for new space-saving packaging the box for the beocenter 6 is kept to a minimum so that it only accounts for 60 per cent of the previous amount of packaging later in the year the packaging also won a worldstar at the annual awards for the world s best packaging solutions reduced packaging also has environmental benefits in terms of transport as more products can be shipped on the same lorry resulting in more efficient use of transport and reduced co2 emissions back to contents 41 new requirements that can impact on our products at present no new requirements are expected to impact on the annual accounts packaging for beocenter 6-26 after and before the reduction in packaging on the supplier front we have worked actively with corporate social responsibility csr for the past three years the csr guidelines are set out in bang olufsen s code of conduct which all suppliers must sign up to suppliers are divided into three risk groups where suppliers in the high-risk group are subject to a three-part audit bang olufsen recognizes that responsible supplier management is an ongoing process consequently our aim is not to use the code of conduct to terminate a relationship with a supplier where an audit reveals critical deviations rather we initiate joint action plans designed to improve the supplier s environmental and social standards the implemented re-audits show improvements at supplier level with regard to human rights employee rights and the environment as early as the product development stage we place extensive environmental demands on our products the so-called compulsory features in addition to purely statutory requirements these compulsory features comprise internal requirements that exceed the statutory ones one new compulsory feature introduced in is a ban on the use of the element tantalum/coltan extraction of tantalum/ coltan in the congo has raised ethical questions relating to human rights and endangered animals in the area up to now we have used condensers that contain tantal but we are now phasing out the use of this over the past year we continued to monitor other countries implementation of product environmentrelated legislation including the two eu directives weee3 and rohs4 within as well as outside europe we also continuously update our knowledge on 42 back to contents in december 2006 the eu commission approved the new chemical regulation reach5 the part of reach that deals with materials and preparations has no direct bearing on us as we do not import from non-european countries with regard to the evaluation of chemicals in articles we have decided to participate actively together with the danish environmental protection agency and dhi in the pre-project the consequences of reach for electronic companies requirements for downstream use of preparations and production of chemicals at the time of writing the project is nearing completion and all indications are that the part of reach that relates to chemicals in articles will not impact on us on the backdrop of reach and participation in the project we have initiated an internal chemical reduction programme under which the purchase and use of cmr6 materials class 1 and 2 are prohibited at bang olufsen having completed the substitution of these chemicals we believe that reach will have no consequences for bang olufsen no external environmental issues have or could have a significant impact on bang olufsen s financial position and bang olufsen s mechanics factory has been approved in accordance with the danish environmental protection act s section 5 with regard to changes to processes and production layout the objective is to eliminate or limit pollution whenever possible we maintain a regular dialogue with the authorities to establish the best solutions and minimise pollution e.g by using cleaner technology bat7 bang olufsen prepares annual statutory green accounts for the anodising plant anodising is an electro-chemical treatment of aluminium which results in a highly durable surface structure this surface structure means that with ordinary use the aluminium element will retain its original attractive appearance for many years as well as the

36,Bang & Olufsen,ANN,2008,environment environmental policy bang olufsen takes a holistic approach to the environmental impact our production and our products have on our employees customers and surroundings consequently the word environment encompasses the working environment the product environment as well as the external environment as an environmentally responsible company bang olufsen wishes to develop sustainable products regard for our products useful qualities design and lifetime must be balanced against the impact on our surroundings in particular this means that we ¬∑ develop and produce products under conditions that meet the requirements of iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 standards ¬∑ continually prevent or improve the working environment for the benefit of our employees health and safety industrial accidents and work-related illnesses environmental impact from our activities and products on our surroundings ¬∑ communicate openly about our environmental issues ¬∑ maintain a high standard of information for our employees so that our environmental work is transparent and a natural part of our daily work ¬∑ ensure that individuals who work for and on behalf of bang olufsen have the necessary knowledge about the environment to enable them to perform their work in a responsible manner environmental issues the bang olufsen logo is a guarantee for quality bang olufsen wants customers to buy bang olufsen products in the knowledge that we have made all key decisions on their behalf also in respect of environmental issues bang olufsen develops high quality products that last for many years owing to their timeless design 20-30 year-old bang olufsen products that are in perfect working order can still be found in many 1 homes on average bang olufsen products have a lifetime of 10-15 years with no deterioration in their picture and sound quality in order to maintain high quality throughout a product s lifetime it is tested prior to being launched in the market consequently the product can withstand cold heat bumps sunlight dust etc in the event that a product develops a fault it can of course be repaired mechanical spare parts such as back parts and front materials are also available should scratches or other damage occur the high quality and long lifetime of our products has a positive effect on the environment on the supplier side bang olufsen has worked actively with corporate social responsibility csr for the past four years the csr guidelines are set out in bang olufsen s code of conduct to which all suppliers must sign up suppliers are divided into three risk groups where those in the high-risk group are subject to a three-part audit bang olufsen recognises that responsible supplier management is an ongoing process consequently the aim is not to use the code of conduct to terminate a relationship with a supplier where an audit reveals critical deviations rather the company initiates joint action plans designed to improve the supplier s environmental and social standards the implemented re-audits show improvements at the suppliers within the areas covered by bang olufsen s code of conduct the result of life cycle analysis of bang olufsen s products shows that the most significant environmental impact is energy consumption in customers homes it has therefore been natural for bang olufsen to focus its environmental efforts on reducing stand-by consumption since this is often regarded as a waste of energy to a significant extent bang olufsen is at the leading edge of the latest eup directive in december the eu commission adopted the first implementing measure under the eup directive as a result electric and electronic products must have a standby and/or off mode function and may not consume more than 1w in standby/off mode this requirement which came into force on 7 january will be increased in to a maximum of 0.5w council directive 2005/32/ec eup is an abbreviation of the directive s english title energy using products for the electronics industry this primarily relates to the reduction of the products energy consumption during the user phase back to contents 43 bang olufsen of course meets all current requirements and will continue to focus on minimising stand-by consumption the eu commission has also presented a proposal regarding the environmental requirements for tvs in respect of maximum power consumption when switched on the proposal also sets out requirements relating to power consumption during standby and requirements for automatically switching to standby although the proposal has not yet been adopted bang olufsen has already begun to implement these requirements in the tvs under development moreover the eu is considering the introduction of a-g energy labelling for tvs a system already used for white goods the commission and the eu parliament have not yet reached agreement on the drafting of this proposal bang olufsen is monitoring the development of the bill concerning energy labelling of tvs over the past year the company has monitored international product environment legislation that may impact on the company s products and sales internationally the general trend is for the adoption and implementation of european legislation including the weee2 and rohs3 directives the company keeps abreast of any new requirements that can affect its products there are currently no indications that new requirements will impact on the annual accounts the revised battery directive4 came into force on 26 september and contains a requirement regarding the content of materials in batteries including lead cadmium and mercury as well as their labelling there is also a requirement that products containing batteries should be designed so that the batteries are easy to remove by consumers or waste processors 2 the most important issue for the company in connection with the implementation of the revised battery directive is manufacturer responsibility and the implementation of the weee directive manufacturers of batteries or products that contain batteries are obliged to collect handle and ensure the utilisation of batteries as the majority of bang olufsen s products contain batteries the company is affected by these requirements bang olufsen meets these obligations by participating in collective schemes around europe enrolment in such schemes takes place on an ongoing basis as the european countries implement the battery directive in december 2006 the eu commission adopted the new chemical regulation reach5 the part of reach that deals with materials and preparations has no direct bearing on bang olufsen as the company does not import materials from non-european countries however based on reach bang olufsen has initiated an internal chemical reduction programme under which the purchase and use of cmr materials class 1 and 2 are prohibited in order to create a better working environment for its employees reach also covers chemicals in products and the import of such products although not in the form of a ban but an obligation to inform consumers in partnership with the environmental protection agency and dhi6 bang olufsen participated in the pre-project the consequences of reach for electronic companies requirements for downstream use of preparations and production of chemicals as a result bang olufsen has with regard to chemicals in products decided that its contracts must stipulate that suppliers must not sell products to the company that contain materials that appear on the list of substances of very high concern svhc this list has been prepared by the european chemicals agency on behalf of the council directive 2002/96/ec weee is an abbreviation of the directive s

water environment and health 44 back to contents european commission the svhc list is continually updated and bang olufsen is currently identifying whether there is a need for dispensations in respect of for instance the company s cables the immediate assessment is that reach currently does not impact on bang olufsen however as the list of svhc is continually updated developments will be monitored to ascertain whether there are materials that are essential to bang olufsen and its products there are no external environmental issues that have or could have a significant impact on bang olufsen s financial position bang olufsen s mechanics factory is approved in accordance with the danish environmental protection act s section 5 with regard to changes to processes and production layout the objective is to eliminate or limit pollution whenever possible the company maintains a regular dialogue with the authorities to create the best solutions and minimise pollution e.g by using cleaner technology bat8 if processed correctly electronic scrap is a valuable source for recovering raw materials in large parts of the world discarded electric and electronic products are collected and processed at approved waste processors where they are separated into different material fractions metal printed circuit boards plastic glass and screens the separation is often carried out by hand alternatively shredders are used to automatically sort the metal and plastic fractions for subsequent use for the production of new raw materials copper and other metals from printed circuit boards are also recycled materials that can not be recycled are sent for incineration which generates energy otherwise they are despatched as waste future disposal is also considered when bang olufsen designs new products all plastic parts are 8 labelled so that waste processors can identify the type of plastic bang olufsen carries out disassembly tests to demonstrate how products are to be separated at the time of disposal what material fractions the product consists of and what proportion of the product can be recycled in addition proposals for manufacturing improvements are put forward which benefit future products such disassembly tests show that over 65 per cent of material components in bang olufsen s tvs can be recycled the eu directive concerning the disposal of electric and electronic waste weee states that a minimum of 65 per cent of all collected electronics for entertainment purposes must be recycled which bang olufsen naturally complies with bang olufsen prepares annual statutory green accounts for its anodising plant anodising is an electro-chemical treatment of aluminium which results in a highly durable surface structure this surface structure means that with ordinary use the aluminium element will retain its original attractive appearance for many years in addition to the green accounts the company prepares an annual voluntary environmental review which details the environmental aspects of production at bang olufsen s factories as well as the company s working environment conditions for a number of products and business areas an environmental review to the last detail an account of environmental awareness told through the development production use and disposal of a specific product has been prepared to the last

37,Bang & Olufsen,ANN,2010,"corporate social responsibility the bang olufsen logo is a guarantee of quality and has been since its creation in 1925 this not only applies to bang olufsen s quality products but also to its strong and enduring relationships with customers and suppliers similarly it is important for bang olufsen to have committed employees and to demonstrate respect for the environment both for the company s immediate surroundings near the factories and a product s footprint during its lifecycle it has therefore always been important for bang olufsen to take responsibility for sustainability across the entire business human rights bang olufsen aim in all matters within the group 's control to support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights in order to formalise and clarify the csr principles to which the company adheres bang olufsen adopted a csr policy in bang olufsen attaches great importance to freedom of association and recognizes the right to collective bargaining we want to be an inclusive workplace where each employee can thrive and have the ability to evolve and create a good balance between leisure and work employee rights bang olufsen aims to show the greatest degree of social responsibility towards our employees we support the abolition of child labor and forced labor and we condemn discrimination in employment and occupation csr policy of bang olufsen group it is important for bang olufsen to integrate social societal and environmental considerations into our activities therefore we have been working with csr corporate social responsibility within the framework of our business we want to create sustainable products seen in a life-cycle perspective and thus take an active responsibility for the society we are a part of the main purpose of this policy is to set the general guidelines for the continuation of this work and to ensure that the group is conscious of the choices made in the field of csr policy the policy is divided into four main issues human rights labor rights environment and anticorruption under each item is prepared an implementation plan that will be an organic document that ensures continuous improvement the four main points is seen by bang olufsen as fundamental values therefore we seek not only to ensure compliance with ourselves but also within our partners including subcontractors why compliance with the four main points is included in the group 's agreements with them environment at bang olufsen we think about the environmental impacts that our production and products have on our employees customers and environment from an overall perspective this means that when we use the word `` environment '' it covers the broad disciplines of working environment product environment and external environment bang olufsen produces products with a long life which in itself is beneficial to the environment at the same time we are constantly working to find comprehensive and lasting solutions to ensure that the consideration for our products' performance design and life are in mutual balance with our impacts on the surroundings when products are disposed of the most possible must be able to be reused and incorporated into a new life cycle anti corruption the group is strongly opposed to all forms of corruption including extortion and bribery back to contents 31 environmental conditions that have significant environmental impact bang olufsen divides its environmental work into three main areas working environment the external environment and product environment bang olufsen is iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 certified which covers the three main areas in accordance with the standards bang olufsen has to define and risk assess key working environment and environmental conditions the company has decided to do this in the following way the initial environmental survey of the external environment was conducted according to the key2greens scoring system1 and is updated when significant changes occur during the survey environmental parameters are scored according to the risk of accidents the impact on the environment/working environment and the economy the highest scoring environmental impact forms the basis for the objectives targets and action plans the working environment survey is based on risk assessment forms comprising a range of parameters such as industrial accidents the psychological working environment and workplace assessment2 the salient factors are subsequently assembled into a matrix of risk assessment used in the procurement of new equipment or in connection with key changes that impact the environment or working environment environmental targets in relation to key environmental conditions in connection with the certification of the external and product environments according to the iso 14001 standard and working environment in accordance with ohsas 18001 the following targets have been established across all bang olufsen s activities in denmark for the 2010/11 financial year the targets are as follows in table 1 area target measuring point duration industrial accidents accident frequency should not exceed the level frequency 3.7 frequency 3 years energy 5 reduction per year total in consumption of natural gas and electricity 0.45 kwh/ earned salary krone kwh/earned salary krone 3 years risk assessment no difference in respect of carrying out risk assessment no differrence between internal and external audit 3 years table 1 targets for the 2010/11 financial year 1 key2green scoring system was developed by cowi the environmental impact is scored so that the environmental impact is weighted this is done by assessing every environmental impact on the basis of volume/size distribution scale global regional local and effect reversible irreversible each of the three parameters is assigned a score of 1- 3 depending on the extent of the problem when multiplying the scores for volume spread and effect the resulting figure indicates the extent of the problem in total there are 10 possible levels 1 2 3 4 6 8 9 12 18 and 27 the higher the score the greater is the potential problem 2 workplace assessment apv is a tool to identify working environment conditions at individual workplaces apv is also used to set targets and action plans for working environment back to contents 32 working environment bang olufsen places great emphasis on the employees working environment the aim is to create a safe and healthy working environment with focus on both the physical and psychological working environment bang olufsen organises work stations to accommodate employees not the other way round the working environment therefore forms an integral part of the product right from the design and development phases because the choices made by product developers often have a major impact on the working environment during the production phase e.g choice of materials joining methods and choice of surface treatment accidents and risk assessment bang olufsen is focused on improvements within the working environment area the following target was set for the 2010/11 financial year i.e the accident frequency should not exceed the levels frequency 3.7 as a result of the rise in industrial accidents the company has intensified its focus on this risk assessment has been introduced as a target where action plans have been created to support the process the risk assessment action plans include ensuring that all new employees including colleagues who have switched to another job within the company receive introduction to working environment and the environment in addition the environmental group will be involved in the procurement of new equipment and in respect of any major changes a risk assessment is carried out in this connection increased registration of near misses is also designed to prevent industrial accidents in the second half of 2010/11 a task force was set up with the aim of focusing on the increasing number of industrial accidents the task force comprises employees from the environmental department the environmental coordinator and environmental groups the task force together with the injured person and the environmental group is responsible for identifying the underlying causes of the accident remedial action is initiated based on the causes identified bang olufsen has sought to increase awareness of the increased number of accidents by reporting on the accidents on the company s intranet bang olufsen will continue to raise awareness of this area and develop new tools and initiatives to help support the company s objectives the accident analysis has contributed to the fact that there has only been one accident since the project s start in december results as shown in fig 1 there were 14 industrial accidents in 2010/11 this is a significant rise on previous years which has meant that the accident frequency target of 3.7 has failed to materialise it is expected that the new initiatives with regard to risk assessment and accident analysis will help to reduce the number of industrial accidents for the next financial year number of frequency accidents target 6 18 16 5.4 1 5.3 5 14 4.1 3.9 12 3 3.0 8 3 6 11 4 3 2 8 1 5 2 0 09/10 0 07/08 fig 1 the diagram shows

parameters as described in the previous section and designated by senior management as part of the leadership s annual assessment of the environment and working environment environmental groups consist of one employee representative and one management representative who cover one specific area the environmental groups comprise both the occupational health area and the environment together with the management group the environmental groups are responsible for the psychological working environment back to contents 33 the measuring point for risk assessment has been achieved since no difference between the internal or external audit has been identified exceeding one watt bang olufsen of course complies with the new eu regulations and will continue to focus on reducing its products standby consumption product environment results bang olufsen considers the environment as early as possible in the product lifecycle consequently the company has set out comprehensive environmental requirements for its products during the product development phase known as compulsory features these environmental requirements include apart from the purely legislative requirements internal demands that extend beyond the legal requirements watt 1.20 1.00 0.80 0.90 0.90 0.86 0.78 the use of compulsory features complies with eu directives and other international legislation in this way bang olufsen can be confident that its products are in accordance with local legislation in every market where bang olufsen sells products the compulsory features also comply with rohs weee the battery directive the packaging directive and various labelling schemes 0.60 other compulsory features extend beyond legislative requirements this is the case for instance with a ban on a number of chemical compounds such as brominated flame retardants and requirements for the marking of plastic parts fig 2 the average standby consumption for all bang olufsen tvs speakers and audio products sold in individual financial years the calculation is sales weighted and thus expresses bang olufsen 's environmental impact on the market bang olufsen icepower bang olufsen products primarily use energy efficient amplifiers from bang olufsen icepower in conventional amplifiers only around 20 per cent of the input power is converted to output power the remaining approx 80 per cent is converted to heat as a result amplifiers are normally equipped with large cooling plates to conduct the heat away from the amplifier under normal conditions bang olufsen icepower reduces power consumption by 70 per cent in addition to the fact that bang olufsen icepower amplifiers reduce power consumption when the appliance is switched on resource consumption is also lower because no materials are needed for large cooling plates standby consumption lifecycle analyses of bang olufsen products show that the greatest environmental impact derives from the customer s home it was therefore natural for bang olufsen to focus its environmental efforts on reducing standby consumption 0.59 0.40 0.20 0.00 06/07 07/08 08/09 09/10 10/11 the average standby consumption for the 2010/11 financial year fell compared to the previous financial year this is due to the launch of new products with a low standby consumption and to the fact that some of the products that had a high standby consumption have been withdrawn from the product portfolio during the year under review the company continued to monitor international environmental legislation that could affect the company s products and sales similarly the company keeps updated on any new requirements that may impact on its products and will also continue to focus on reducing energy consumption over the lifecycle of its products including to an increasing extent work on reducing the products consumption when switched on under new eu regulations it is no longer permitted to import or produce electronic devices with standby consumption 4 rohs

requirements for electric and electronic products batteries and their packaging back to contents 34 external environment it is important to bang olufsen that the pollution from the company s activities is limited as much as possible and that the production does not cause annoyance to local residents there is therefore ongoing focus on new projects and follow-up on already existing buildings and activities the company is in ongoing dialogue with the regulatory bodies with a view to identifying the best solutions and thereby limiting pollution bang olufsen s mechanic factory is environmentally approved in accordance with the environmental protection act s section 5 as environmental approval was revised in it will not be revised again until 2020 in the event of changes to processes and production layout the basic aim is to prevent pollution or limit any pollution to the greatest possible extent the pollution potential from the company s other factories is so slight that the local environmental authorities have decided that the activities do not require environmental approval bang olufsen however imposes the same requirements on these factories as apply to the mechanic factory during the 2010/11 financial year there were no breakdowns and bang olufsen received no complaints from neighbours concerning the external environment the introduction of

scrap is processed correctly it is a valuable source of recovery of raw materials in large parts of the world discarded electrical and electronic products must be collected and processed by approved waste receivers the product is separated into different material fractions metal printing plates plastic glass and screen which are then recycled for the manufacture of new materials materials that can not be recycled are sent if possible for incineration this in turn generates energy bang olufsen also considers disposal in the design of new products all plastic parts are labelled so that waste receivers can identify the type of plastic a disassembly test demonstrates how the product will be separated when disposed of its material fractions and how much of the product can be recycled in addition there are proposals for design improvements that can benefit future products the disassembly tests show that between 75 and 86 per cent of the material parts of a bang olufsen television can be recycled the eu directive concerning the disposal of electrical and electronic waste weee demands that a minimum of 65 per cent of all collected electronics used for entertainment must be recycled

naturally bang olufsen recognises the un and ilo declarations on human rights labour rights the environment and anti-corruption for which reason we have chosen to structure our csr work and reporting according to the un's global compact in 2012/13 bang olufsen intends to undertake new activities to strengthen the csr efforts initiation of independent external supplier audits assessments of the need for tier 2 supplier assessments expansion of the company 's internal code of ethics to include the sales organisation establishment of a whistleblowing function bang olufsen 's csr policy in order to formalise and elucidate the csr principles followed by the company bang olufsen adopted a csr policy in 2011/12 the csr policy underlines that bang olufsen wants to be a reliable and ethical responsible business partner to suppliers and other stakeholders the company will contribute to improve people s conditions and provide its employees with a framework that will motivate them and give

work on the areas with the greatest potential for improvement 1 bang olufsen csr reporting 1 august the 2011/12 adoption of a csr policy ensures that efforts within human rights labour rights and anti-corruption are prioritised on the same terms as the other focus areas the csr work covers four important focus areas ÔÇ∑ ÔÇ∑ ÔÇ∑ ÔÇ∑ minimisation of the impact on the external environment through process optimisation e.g reduction of the energy consumption and waste volumes at the facilities environmental improvements through product development including reduction of the products electricity consumption and enhanced possibilities of recycling components improvement of occupational health and safety e.g by reducing the number and severity of industrial injuries safeguarding of human and labour rights for the employees of the component suppliers which are primarily located in asia to support its csr policy bang olufsen has implemented a code of conduct for suppliers setting out the company 's values in key areas such as the environment human rights labour rights and anti-corruption so that they are clearly communicated to suppliers and other stakeholders finally the company has implemented an internal code of ethics with guidelines for among other things the exchange of gifts negotiation principles and conflicts of interest group targets and results the adoption of a csr policy for the entire group was a significant result in 2011/12 good results were also achieved within the areas of environment and work environment even though all formal targets were not achieved in 2011/12 four csr targets for the group were set up they all related to the environment and occupational health and safety as these areas are of particular relevance in an electronics company 2 bang

group 's control to support and respect the protection of internationally declared human rights bang olufsen endeavours to display corporate social responsibility of the highest level in relation to its own employees and working conditions at the company 's suppliers it goes without saying that bang olufsen supports the abolition of child labour and forced labour as well as dissociating itself from workplace discrimination bang olufsen attaches great importance to freedom of association and recognises the right to negotiate collectively the company wants to be an accommodating workplace in which the individual employee thrives and has the chance to develop and establish a good work-life balance responsible supplier control bang olufsen 's most important work in relation to human and labour rights is done in collaboration with the company 's suppliers bang olufsen works actively to ensure that for example no suppliers use child labour or forced labour or generate unnecessary environmental impact during the production of materials for bang olufsen as part of its work on responsible supplier control bang olufsen has drawn up a code of conduct setting out the company 's values in key areas such as the environment and climate human rights labour rights and anti-corruption so that they are clearly communicated to suppliers and other stakeholders all bang olufsen 's direct suppliers must sign the code of conduct and with it the requirements that bang olufsen expects each and every supplier to 3 bang olufsen csr reporting 1 august live up to at the same time by signing the document the direct suppliers must ensure that their suppliers in turn abide by the same guidelines and regulations a risk analysis of bang olufsen 's suppliers is carried out once a year and the results are used to focus attention on suppliers considered at risk of breaching the company 's code of conduct the risk is assessed on the basis of local conditions in the supplier 's home country among other things such suppliers can subsequently expect to be subjected to an audit intended to identify opportunities for improving conditions if necessary in recent years audits have been carried out by bang olufsen 's own purchasing organisation which also assesses suppliers csr in day-to-day cooperation this ensures an immediate response to any conspicuous problems in 2012/13 audits will be carried out in collaboration with external independent auditors specialising in csr all new suppliers in high-risk countries e.g southeast asia and eastern europe will undergo an external audit an assessment will also be made in the course of the year as to whether there is a need to audit bang olufsen 's suppliers higher up the value chain it is not the intention to use supplier control to break off cooperation with the supplier if an audit reveals critical irregularities instead the company will initiate cooperation on action plans aimed at improving the supplier's environmental and social standards working environment bang olufsen wants to create a safe and healthy working environment for its employees with the emphasis on both the physical and psychological working environments bang olufsen 's danish activities received ohsas 18001 certification in and the three external audits that have been carried out did not give rise to any nonconformities one external audit has been completed in 2011/12 working environment is incorporated in the product right from the design and development phase as the choices made by the product developer often have a major impact on working environment in the production phase including materials assembly methods and surface treatment risk assessments are carried out for new equipment new processes and production changes prior to implementation so as to minimise the risk of accidents while action plans are drawn up for areas for improvement ensuring among other things that all new recruits and employees who change job within the company are introduced to the working environment and environment close calls are recorded and analysed so as to reduce the risks of future accidents as much as possible 4 bang olufsen csr reporting 1 august in 2011/12 in addition to the adoption of a csr policy two group targets were set within human and labour rights policy area human- and labour rights human- and labour rights subject reduction of the number of industrial injuries per 1 million working hours reduction of the number of hours of absence per 1,000 working hours due to industrial injuries target frequency not to exceed 3.5 result 2011/12 frequency of 4.3 severity not to exceed 0.154 severity of 0.095 eleven industrial injuries were recorded in 2011/12 equivalent to a frequency of 4.3 the

bang olufsen csr reporting 1 august course continuing group targets for the working environment will be set in 2012/13 too environment the environment is of particular importance as a csr target area for bang olufsen and it is divided into product environment and external environment product environment encompasses the environmental issues linked to the company 's products such as electricity consumption in the use phase external environment encompasses the environmental issues linked to the company 's own production such as waste and consumption of raw materials electricity heat and water work is constantly being done to find holistic and sustainable solutions so as to ensure that considerations regarding the features design and life of our products are in balance with impact on the environment when our products are eventually disposed of it must be possible to recycle as much of them as possible for use in a new life cycle bang olufsen 's danish activities received iso 14001 certification in and the three external audits that have been carried out did not give rise to any nonconformities one external audit was completed in 2011/12 the main issues in terms of the external environment are energy consumption and waste from production the main product-related environmental issue is electricity consumption in the use phase bang olufsen makes products with a long life which contributes to lower resource consumption in general and less waste than in the case of products with a short life their design is timeless and many homes have bang olufsen products that are 20 or 30 years old on average a bang olufsen product has a life of 10-15 years without any deterioration in sound or picture quality bang olufsen supplies spare parts for its products for up to 12 years after a product is last made older bang olufsen products also remain in great demand and the market for used bang olufsen products is relatively large which helps to further strengthen the bang olufsen brand as offering sought-after products that last external environment it is important to bang olufsen that pollution from the company 's activities should be kept to an absolute minimum and that production should not cause any nuisance for neighbours there is therefore an ongoing emphasis on both new projects and follow-up on existing buildings and activities the company always enters into a dialogue with the regulatory authorities with a view to finding the best solutions and thereby limiting pollution as much as possible environmental approval under part 5 of the danish environmental protection act milj√∏beskyttelsesloven is required for just a single bang olufsen factory which is located in struer the environmental approval was re-audited in and is not due to be audited again until 2020 the environmental approval relates to surface treatment and mechanical processing of aluminium a licence has also been granted to discharge process waste water to a purification plant belonging to the factory 6 bang olufsen csr reporting 1 august there were no operating accidents in 2011/12 nor did bang olufsen receive any complaints from neighbours one group target was set for

reduction in total energy consumption energy consumption fell both nominally and relative to production volume the savings were achieved by among other things setting up what are called beoenergy groups among the employees who work in a targeted way to reduce energy consumption the beoenergy project helps to change employees habits when using tools and office machines and together with

environment bang olufsen incorporates environmental considerations in the life cycle of its products by setting comprehensive environmental requirements for products right from the product development phase they are called mandatory requirements and ensure compliance with european directives and other legislation including rohs weee the battery directive the packaging directive and various labelling schemes in this way bang olufsen knows that the products leaving the factory comply with local legislation on all the markets where bang olufsen sells products electricity consumption in use phase electricity consumption in the use phase is a significant environmental issue 8 bang olufsen csr reporting 1 august and is made up of a product 's standby electricity consumption and electricity consumption when the product is in use on mode bang olufsen's televisions automatically turn themselves off after four hours of inactivity the results of life cycle analyses for bang olufsen 's products show that the greatest environmental impact is energy consumption in the customer 's home this has made it natural for bang olufsen to focus its environmental efforts on among other things reducing standby consumption which can be regarded as pure waste the following diagram shows the total annual electricity consumption for all bang olufsen products sold in the 2011/12 financial year and the average electricity consumption per product both total electricity consumption and electricity consumption per product have fallen in the last 2 financial years this is partly because newer television models have been upgraded with new technology but also because the product mix has changed owing to the successful launch of the new smaller products in the b o play range mwh 30,000 160

power is converted to output power the remaining 80 is converted into heat that is why amplifiers normally have large cooling fins to disperse the heat in normal use bang olufsen icepower reduces power consumption by 70 in addition to bang olufsen icepower amplifiers reducing power consumption when the unit is on resource consumption is also reduced as materials do not have to be used for large cooling fins disposal of worn-out products electronic scrap is a valuable source for recycling raw materials if it is 9 bang olufsen csr reporting 1 august processed correctly in much of the world worn-out electrical and electronic products have to be collected and processed by an approved waste handler the product is separated into different material fractions metal pcbs plastic glass and screens which are then used to make new raw materials as far as possible the materials that can not be recycled are sent for incineration with the energy being recovered bang olufsen also gives thought to disposal when it designs new products for example all plastic components are labelled so that waste handlers can identify the type of plastic involved the european waste electrical and electronic equipment directive weee requires at least 65 of all entertainment electronics collected to be recyclable and it has to be possible to make use of a further 10 by means of incineration with energy recovery although the manufacturers are not directly responsible for ensuring this when bang olufsen develops new products it has a dismantling test carried out to show how the product will be stripped down at disposal what material fractions the product consists of and how much of the product can be recycled suggestions are also made for design improvements that could be used in future products these dismantling tests show that between 75 and 86 of the material components in bang olufsen 's televisions can be recycled the figure below shows recycling and energy recovery for some of

to delivering products of high quality to the customers but also in relation to the way the business is run bang olufsen naturally recognises un and ilo declarations regarding human rights labour rights environment and anti-corruption and has therefore chosen to structure the csr work including the csr policy in accordance with the un global compact bang olufsen has taken the environment into consideration for many years but the topics have changed character and new standards have appeared through the years traditionally focus has been on the products and the production including work environment and the external environment today the consideration for the environment is more oriented towards a product life cycle and the corporate social responsibility and as a consequence the product in an environmental context has become an important parameter bang olufsen considers the environment in a closed life cycle where waste is a resource which can be recycled in other products at the same time bang olufsen wishes to take an active co-responsibility for the society which we are part of through a number of years we have worked with corporate social responsibility within the framework of our business this is best illustrated by the picture of a closed life cycle with a smiley which symbolizes the work with csr in the middle we call it ‚Äò design for sustainability bang

policy is to provide the main guidelines for the continuation of this work and to ensure that the group is aware of the choices which are made within the csr policy the policy is divided into four main areas human rights workers rights environment and anti-corruption an implementation plan is in place for each area which will be an organic document which will ensure ongoing improvements the four main areas are bang olufsen basic values not only do we endeavour to ensure own compliance but also our business partners including suppliers where compliance with the four main areas is included in the group s purchase agreements human rights bang olufsen endeavours in all situations within the group s control to support and respect the protection of internationally declared human rights labour rights bang olufsen endeavours to show the greatest possible degree of social responsibility in relation to our employees naturally we support the abolishment of child and forced labour as we also eschew labour and employment discrimination bang olufsen puts great emphasis on the freedom of association and recognize the right to collective negotiations we wish to be an inclusive work place where the individual employee can thrive and develop and create a good work life balance environment at bang olufsen we take a holistic view of the environmental impact our production and products have on our employees customers and environment this means that when we use the word environment it broadly covers the disciplines work- product and external environment bang olufsen produces products with a long lifetime which in itself is beneficial to the environment at the same time we continually work on finding complete and durable solutions to ensure that the consideration to our products

concentrated in the areas with main potential for improvement the csr policy is supported by bang olufsen 's code of conduct which contains the company s demands to suppliers within the csr area in 2012/13 the existing code of conduct from 2005 together with the associated self-assessment schedule has been updated to existing standards and is now in conjunction with the csr policy and the un global compact in addition to this external independent supplier audits have been reintroduced at suppliers in high-risk countries e.g south east asia 30 high-risk suppliers in total have been identified and are audited on an ongoing basis in 2012/13 10 audits were carried out all new suppliers in high-risk countries will be subject to an external audit through code of conduct bang olufsen demands suppliers to comply with the csr demands in their own supply chains external audits further back in the supply chain are carried out when there is a concrete suspicion of breach of code of conduct in 2005 bang olufsen 's purchase department made its own moral and ethics in the purchase department at bang olufsen which included internal anti-corruption guidelines for e.g gift exchange negotiation principles and handling of conflicts of interest it is important to be credible and reliable both internally and externally therefore bang olufsen has extended the internal anti-corruption guidelines to also include the sales organisation this is most relevant in relation to the new markets where bang olufsen currently is expanding the business to support the guidelines bang olufsen has

bang olufsen makes products with a long lifetime which contribute to generally lower resource consumption and reduced waste quantities compared to products with short lifespans the design is timeless and today many homes have bang olufsen products which are 20-30 years old on average a bang olufsen product has a lifetime of 10-15 years without loss of sound- or picture quality bang olufsen supply spare parts to the products up to 12 years after a product has been produced for the last time in addition there is still a large demand for older bang olufsen products and the market for used bang olufsen products is relatively large which contributes to strengthening the bang olufsen brand as attractive high-quality products with a long lifetime the relatively long lifetime in comparison to many other electronic products alone means that bang olufsen is not part of the use throw away culture which means that the impact on the planet s raw material resources is lower when bang olufsen products are chosen responsible supplier management bang olufsen makes an active effort to ensure that no suppliers use for instance child labour forced labour or unnecessarily overload the environment to produce bang olufsen materials the agent in this relation is called responsible supplier management which bang olufsen started to systematically use in 2005 csr rapport_25/06/2013 rih page 4 as part of the work with responsible supplier management bang olufsen has set up a code of conduct which in central areas such as environment and climate human rights labour rights and anti- corruption explain the company s values in order for these to be clearly communicated to suppliers bang olufsen's code of conduct partly builds on the ten principles in the un global compact partly on the un conventions on human rights in 2012/13 the existing code of conduct from 2005 together with a self- assessment schedule has been updated to current standards in the area and is now in conjunction with the csr policy and the un global compact all direct suppliers to bang olufsen must sign the code of conduct and thereby the demands to which bang olufsen expects the individual suppliers to comply with at the same time the direct suppliers promise with their signature that their sub- suppliers comply with the same guidelines and demands once a year a risk analysis is made of bang olufsen s suppliers and the efforts are hereafter focused on suppliers with a high risk of violating the code of conduct these suppliers subsequently can expect an audit which aims to uncover the possibilities for improving the conditions in total 30 high risk suppliers have been identified and 10 audits have been carried out in 2012/13 the work with responsible supplier management is a continuous process the intention is therefore not to use the code of conduct to terminate the cooperation with the supplier if an audit reveals critical deviations instead the company will initiate cooperation on action plans to improve the supplier s environmental and social standards production production the environmental area is a particularly important csr action area for bang olufsen and is split in product environment described under use phase in use at the customer working environment and external environment product environment are the environmental conditions that are attached to the company s products e.g energy consumption in the use phase the working environment is to secure a safe and healthy environment for the employees to work in e.g prevention of industrial injuries and workrelated illness the external environment is the environmental conditions that are primarily attached to the company s own production e.g raw material usage electricity consumption heat consumption water consumption and waste bang olufsen s danish activities have been environmentally certified iso 14.001 and the working environment certified ohsas 18.001 since and no exceptions have been noted at the four external audits that have been carried out since the certification in bang olufsen was nominated to the working environment council s annual working environment prize in spring bang olufsen was awarded 3f holstebro 's working environment prize csr rapport_25/06/2013 rih page 5 working environment bang olufsen puts great emphasis on creating a safe and healthy working environment for the employees with focus on improving both the physical and psychological working environment the objective is to make the everyday healthier and to encourage the employees to share the responsibility for their own health and life style life style factors such as exercise diet smoking and alcohol are important in our day-to-day focus on health the working environment is considered in the product already in the design and development phases as choices in the early product development phases often have great influence on the work environment in the production phase e.g in the form of choice of material assembly methods and choice of surface treatment risk assessments are made of new equipment new processes and changes in the production in advance of the start-up to minimize the risk of accidents and action plans are prepared for areas of improvement which ensure that all new employees and employees on job rotation are introduced to working environment and environment near miss accidents are registered and analysed to ensure that the risk of future accidents is reduced to the greatest possible extent particularly with focus on prevention there has been extra focus in the work environment objectives for the financial year on reporting of near miss accidents and to secure correct attitudes and behaviour of all employees in bang olufsen the number of injuries with absence during the financial year split by white-collar and blue-collar workers is detailed in the graph below the graph also shows the frequency number of accidents per 1 million working hours and the severity number of hours of absence per 1,000 working hours of the industrial injuries csr rapport_25/06/2013 rih page 6 figure 1 the graph shows the development in the number of accidents and the frequency number of accidents per 1 million working hours and the severity number of hours of absence per 1,000 working hours with five industrial injuries with absence during 2012/13 the frequency is far better than the target at the same time as it is the lowest frequency since 1985 when bang olufsen systematically started to measure the frequency of industrial injuries with absence the number of days that the employees are absent due to industrial injuries are in general 1-2 days but one single more serious accident with 39 days absence has such a great influence on the severity that the target has not been met in the financial year external environment it is important to bang olufsen that pollution from the company s activities should be kept to an absolute minimum and that production should not cause any nuisance to the neighbours as a result focus on new projects and follow-up on existing buildings and activities are ongoing the company always enters into dialogue with the regulatory authorities with a view to finding the best solutions and thereby limiting the pollution as much as possible environmental approval under part 5 of the danish environmental protection act milj√∏beskyttelsesloven is required for just a single bang olufsen factory which is located in struer the environmental approval relates to the surface treatment and mechanical processing of aluminium a licence has also been granted to discharge process waste water to a purification plant attached to the factory no operational accidents occurred in the financial year 2012/13 nor did bang olufsen receive any complaints from neighbours beoenergy is an energy saving project which has been started as bang olufsen wishes to be a green energy-saving company and has an environmental objective to reduce energy consumption by 5 percent per year in the individual factories beoenergy groups have been set up consisting of our environmental groups and consultancy assistance from the technical department and the environmental department the groups work actively to reduce the energy consumption and have mapped the energy consumption and suggestions have been received on energy saving actions habits and behaviour in relation to energy consumption are specifically monitored the total energy consumption and the key performance indicator can been seen below csr rapport_25/06/2013 rih page 7 figure 2 total energy consumption in mwh split by electricity and heat the measured energy consumption has been reduced in the last four years the key performance indicator the environment target will be negatively affected by decreasing capacity usage as the key figure is dependent on the production level transportation transportation reduced packaging reduces the co2 emission the aim of the packaging is to protect the product from the factory and out to the customer insufficient packaging will damage the product and excessive packaging is an environmental problem traditionally bang olufsen has produced packaging for tvs based on a pallet solution this has been necessary as the products are so heavy that they must be handled with a pallet- or fork truck the large packaging gives some practical challenges with the handling at the dealer as it is heavy and unmanageable without lifting aids additionally there is a direct link between the size of the packaging and the environmental load in the form of co2 emission when transporting the products for the tv-series beoplay v1 which consist of tvs in the 32-40 class a different packaging solution without a pallet solution has been opted for which has resulted in the packaging having been reduced significantly now three beoplay v1-40s can be on one pallet compared to one traditionally except for the positive influence from packaging reduction on raw material usage the co2 emission during transportation is also reduced as less air is transported efforts are also being made to find solutions for smaller packaging for the larger tvs csr rapport_25/06/2013 rih page 8 in use at the customer the user phase the result of life cycle analyses of bang olufsen s products shows that the largest environmental load is the energy consumption at home at the customer it has therefore been natural for bang olufsen to among other things focus the environmental effort on reduction of the product s energy consumption the products help save energy the energy consumption in the use phase from entertainment electronics is a major environmental load bang olufsen s products are no exception different functionalities have therefore been implemented with a view to reducing the energy consumption the energy consumption of a tv is among other things dependent on the picture on the screen all bang olufsen tvs have an automatic brightness control which means that the light on the screen is automatically adjusted based on the light conditions in the room which reduces the energy consumption when tv is watched in a dark room instead of in broad daylight in the beovision 11 and beoplay v1 tv s we have introduced an eco mode for both sound and picture this is a setting which the customer can opt for which further reduces the energy consumption there is also a function where a warning will appear on screen if a turned on tv hasn t been used for four hours after which the tv automatically will be switched off this is also the case for the entertainment system encore but in this case it takes 12 hours before it goes on standby today a large number of products use network standby which is a particular form of standby whereby the products can be awakened through an external signal e.g via the customers smartphones in spring eu adopted new regulations for network standby the first regulations will come into force in and bang olufsen s products already meet these the total energy consumption for bang olufsen products sold in the financial year 2012/13 and the average energy consumption can be seen in the graph below energy consumption in the use phase the energy consumption in the use phase is a significant environmental condition and is a combination of the products standby usage and the energy consumption during use of the product on mode the graph below shows the total annual energy consumption for the products which bang olufsen has introduced to the market in the given financial year and the average annual energy consumption by product csr rapport_25/06/2013 rih page 9 figure 3 the diagram shows the total annual energy consumption for all sold bang olufsen products in the financial year 2012/13 and the average energy consumption by product the total energy consumption and the average energy consumption by product have been reduced again this year the reduction is explained by the fact that products with less energy consumption has been launched at the same time as some of the more energy consuming products have been phased out from the product portfolio bang olufsen icepower bang olufsen uses icepower amplifiers in most of the products icepower is a subsidiary of bang olufsen and is a pioneer within class d amplifiers icepower 's amplifiers are different from traditional amplifiers in that they are extremely energy efficient as the amplifiers transform up to 90 per cent of the input effect to output effect by comparison traditional amplifiers only transform approximately 20 per cent of the input current to output effect while the remaining 80 per cent is converted to heat in normal use icepower s amplifiers provide a solution which significantly reduces the power consumption at the same time the resource consumption is reduced as materials do not have to be used for cooling fins on the amplifiers to conduct away the heat bang olufsen s use of icepower amplifiers ensures high sound quality at the same time the environmental load is minimal waste csr rapport_25/06/2013 rih waste page 10 the effort to minimize waste is multiple the objective is to both minimize the amount of waste and secure correct waste sorting the products are also constructed to enable disassembly to ensure that as much as possible can be recycled as raw materials in new products minimizing waste from production scrap is reusable material left over from production and is made up of aluminum glass tv screens electronics etc with the main part being aluminium scrap can in contrast to a lot of other waste have a considerable financial value it is however even more valuable to reduce the amount of scrap from production when scrap is reduced the raw materials are used more efficiently which is of benefit to both the environment and to the cost of the purchase of new raw material and of production bang olufsen therefore has major focus on minimizing the amount of scrap primarily from aluminium which is an important resource in the production already in the product development phase focus is on using the space on the aluminium sheets optimally learning from production is brought back to the development department to ensure that materials which minimize the scrap risk are developed which might not have been the case had focus not been on the issue the amount of scrap has been monitored through a number of years but in the financial year 2012/13 extra focus has been put on a scrap reduction program which identifies the root causes of the departmental fluctuations and provides mechanisms to take adjusted actions the success of the program is secured by a structured management effort and specific solutions which are adapted to the individual departments and which the individual employee is committed to it is important to communicate to both management and employees both in terms of the project s progress and what the individual employee can do to contribute to less scrap in his/her own workplace the scrap reduction program has turned out to be very efficient and the target for 2012/13 has been reached disposal of worn-out products electronic scrap is a valuable source for recycling raw materials if it is processed correctly a large part of the world legislation states that worn-out electrical and electronic products have to be collected and processed by an approved waste handler the product is separated in different material fractions metal pbcs plastic glass and screens which subsequently close the cycle by being reused to produce new raw materials the materials which can not be recycled are as far as possible sent for incineration with the energy being recovered bang olufsen also considers disposal when designing new products for example all plastic components are marked so waste handlers can identify the plastic type involved the european waste electrical and electronic equipment directive weee requires at least 65 per cent of all collected entertainment electronics to be recyclable and a further 10 per cent should be recovered through incineration with energy recovery although the manufacturers are not directly responsible for ensuring this bang olufsen carries out a dismantling test when developing new products to show how the product will be stripped down at disposal what material fractions the product consists of and how much of the product that can be recycled suggestions are also made for design improvements that can be csr rapport_25/06/2013 rih page 11 used in future products the dismantling tests show that more than 75 per cent of the material components in bang olufsen products can be recycled the figure below details recycling and energy consumption for some of the products launched in this financial year figure 4 the graph shows recycling and energy consumption in percentage for some of bang olufsen s products transverse efforts constant efforts are made to find holistic and long-term solutions to ensure that the interest of product performance design and life time are in balance with the impact on the environment when a product is disposed of most of it should be recycled and incorporated into a new life cycle environmental demands to the products bang olufsen considers product environmental issues early in the life cycle of the products by imposing extensive environmental demands to the products already at the product development stage these environmental demands are called mandatory requirements and ensure compliance with eu directives and other legislation including reach rohs weee the battery directive and the packaging directive in this way bang olufsen can guarantee that the products leaving the factory comply with local legislation in all markets where bang olufsen sells products as a consequence there are mandatory requirements which ensure regulatory compliance but also mandatory requirements outside the scope of the legislation such as plastic softening phthalate c.f the section below csr rapport_25/06/2013 rih page 12 substitution of chemicals negative list electronic goods contain a number of chemical substances some have become prohibited from use e.g via eu 's chemicals legislation rohs and reach but in addition to this bang olufsen also has a list of undesirable substances substances on this list are still legal to use but as the substances are under suspicion of being harmful bang olufsen has chosen to out-phase them bang olufsen prohibited for instance the use of all brominated flame retardants already back in the 1990 s and only in 2006 did 2 types of the brominated flame retardants become banned by the rohs directive phthalates is another material which is legal to use so far but has been phased out by bang olufsen the material is often used as plasticizer in pvc wire and is suspected to be endocrine disrupting back in bang olufsen began to phase out phthalates in all cables for installation bang olufsen is now one step further ahead and has chosen to prohibit 4 phthalates in all new products and a further 2 phthalates in wires that come into prolonged contact with the skin e.g in headphones all bang olufsen headphones are now phthalate-free climate and co2 the last six years bang olufsen has reported to the carbon disclosure project which on behalf of a number of investors collects information about the efforts of listed companies in relation to reduction of co2 emission in the entire value chain not only is focus on reducing the energy consumption in the production but also on the energy consumption and transportation of the products the employees travelling activities and so on objectives and activities in the area are described under the sections ‚Äò production and ‚Äò in use at the customer the environment has been considered in new design during the financial year bang olufsen has launched beovision 11 which is a smart tv and a master piece within sound picture and digital entertainment from a design aspect a number of environmental improvements have been considered compared to earlier tvs in the same family for instance in relation to life cycle where considerable considerations have been made regarding construction production energy efficiency in the use phase and the amount of waste beovision 11 is a design for manufacture dfm product so already in the design process focus has been on optimizing assembly and production of the product the tv has a considerable reduced number of screws compared to the previous generation and improvements in the construction of cable binders have been made optimization and reduction of number of prints and fewer materials that should be assembled compared to earlier tv s in the same family from a working environment aspect beovision 11 is easier to assemble in production and is also simpler to dismantle in correct waste fractions when it eventually becomes scrap as a consequence of a lighter tv there is a reduction in resource consumption and waste quantities csr rapport_25/06/2013 rih page 13 the example with beovision 11 shows how bang olufsen considers the life cycle when developing new products figure 5 the figure shows the closed life cycle with the environmental stories that have been discussed in this annual report split by individual

40,Bang & Olufsen,CSR,2013,"bang olufsen a/s csr 2013/14 1 this report is bang olufsen s legally required statement for corporate social responsibility cf financial statements act ¬ß99a an extract can be found in the bang olufsen annual report 2013/14 corporate social responsibility in bang olufsen the bang olufsen logo is a quality guarantee as it has been since the company was established in 1925 this is not only related to delivering products of high quality to the customers but also related to the way the business is run bang olufsen recognises the un and ilo declarations regarding human rights labour rights environment and anti-corruption and has therefore chosen to structure the csr work including the csr policy in accordance with the un global compact guidelines bang olufsen works systematically with csr and is certified in accordance with iso 9001 quality management ts16949 technical standard for quality within the automotive industry iso 14.001 environmental management and ohsas 18.001 work environment management the management systems contribute to ensure that the efforts are concentrated in the areas with main potential for improvement the csr policy is supported by bang olufsen 's code of conduct which contains the company s demands to suppliers within the csr area through the code of conduct bang olufsen requires the suppliers to comply with the csr demands in their own supply chains external audits of the suppliers as well as their sub-suppliers are carried out when there is a concrete suspicion of breach of the code of conduct bang olufsen 's purchase department has prepared a set of guidelines moral and ethics in the purchase department at bang olufsen which includes internal anti-corruption guidelines for e.g gift exchange negotiation principles and handling of conflicts of interest the internal anticorruption guidelines have been extended to include the sales organisation which in particular is relevant for new markets where bang olufsen is currently expanding the business to support the guidelines bang olufsen has set up a whistle-blower function which is an externally run hotline to which the employees anonymously can report unethical behaviour bang olufsen s csr policy the purpose of bang olufsen s csr policy is to state the guidelines for our corporate social responsibility activities within the framework of our business the policy is divided into four main areas human rights labour rights environment and anticorruption each issue has a specific action plan to ensure continual improvement bang olufsen aims to ensure compliance both within its own organization as well as for partners and suppliers human rights bang olufsen aims in all matters within the group 's control to support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights bang olufsen a/s csr 2013/14 2 employee rights bang olufsen aims to show the greatest degree of social responsibility towards our employees we do of course support the abolition of child labour and forced labour and we condemn discrimination in employment and occupation bang olufsen attaches great importance to freedom of association and recognizes the right to collective bargaining we wish to be a tolerant workplace where each employee thrives and has the possibility to develop and create a good work-life balance anti-corruption bang olufsen strongly disassociates itself from all kinds of corruption including extortion and bribery environment and climate bang olufsen has an integrated thinking with regard to the environmental consequences our production and products have on our employees customers and surroundings we use the word '' environment '' broadly to cover the disciplines of work environment product environment and external environment as an environmentally responsible company bang olufsen aims to create sustainable products the considerations involved in the operation design and longevity of our products must be in mutual balance with the environmental impact of production bang olufsen complies with existing legislation in the countries where we produce and sell our products more specifically we aim to focus on the areas where the right balance between effort and impact can be achieved ÔÇ∑ ÔÇ∑ ÔÇ∑ improve the work environment and the health and safety conditions of our employees prevent work related illnesses and/or injuries improve and prevent negative environmental impact from our production and products including reduction of climate impact the csr work and results in the 2013/14 financial year bang olufsen considers the environment in a closed life-cycle where waste is a resource which can be recycled in other products at the same time bang olufsen wishes to take an active coresponsibility for the society of which we are part through a number of years we have worked with corporate social responsibility within the framework of our business this is best illustrated by the picture of a closed life-cycle which symbolizes life-cycle of the products with the csr work in the middle bang olufsen a/s csr 2013/14 3 1.raw material suppliers 5 waste 4 use 2.production environment 3 transportation 1 raw material suppliers bang olufsen makes products with a long lifetime which contribute to generally lower resource consumption and reduced waste quantities compared to products with short lifespans the design is timeless and bang olufsen commits to continuously update software on the consumers products which allows for the bang olufsen products to be long-lasting in addition there is still a large demand for older bang olufsen products and the market for used bang olufsen products is relatively large which contributes to strengthening the bang olufsen brand as attractive high-quality products with a long lifetime the relatively long lifetime in comparison to many other electronic products alone means that bang olufsen is not part of the use and throw away culture which means that the impact on the planet s raw material resources is lower when bang olufsen products are chosen 1.1 responsible supplier management bang olufsen makes an active effort to ensure that no suppliers use for instance child labour forced labour or unnecessarily overload the environment to produce bang olufsen materials the agent in this relation is called responsible supplier management which bang olufsen started to systematically use in 2005 as part of the work with responsible supplier management bang olufsen has set up a code of conduct which in central areas such as environment and climate human rights labour rights and anti- corruption explains the company s values to enable these to be clearly communicated to the suppliers bang olufsen 's code of conduct partly builds on the ten principles in the un global compact and partly on the un conventions on human rights all direct suppliers to bang olufsen must sign the code of conduct and thereby accept the demands that bang olufsen expects the individual suppliers to comply with at the same time the direct suppliers guarantee with their signature that their sub-suppliers comply with the same guidelines and demands once a year a risk analysis is made of bang olufsen s suppliers and the efforts are hereafter focused on suppliers with a high risk of violating the code of conduct these suppliers subsequently can expect an audit which aims to uncover the possibilities for improving the conditions during the 2013/14 financial year previous audits have been followed up and for 2014/15 three to seven new audits are expected bang olufsen a/s csr 2013/14 4 the work with responsible supplier management is a continuous process the intention is therefore not to use the code of conduct to terminate the cooperation with the supplier if an audit reveals critical deviations instead the company will initiate cooperation on action plans to improve the supplier s environmental and social standards 2 production and environment the production and the environmental impact is a particularly important csr focus point for bang olufsen it is divided into product environment described in section 4 use working environment and external environment product environment is the environmental conditions that are attached to the company s products e.g energy consumption in the use phase working environment is the health and safety conditions under which the employees work external environment is the environmental conditions that are related to the company s own production e.g raw material usage electricity consumption heat consumption water consumption and waste bang olufsen s danish activities have been environmentally certified iso 14.001 and the working environment certified ohsas 18.001 since the audit conclusion from our certifying body was b o has a well-managed management system with very committed environmental groups working thoroughly with hse at each of the factories no major non-conformities were raised during the audit 2.1 working environment bang olufsen puts great emphasis on creating a safe and healthy working environment for the employees with focus on improving both the physical and psychological working environment the objective is to make the everyday healthier and to encourage the employees to share the responsibility for their own health and life style life style factors such as exercise diet smoking and alcohol are important in our day-to-day focus on health the working environment is considered in the product already in the design and development phases as choices in the early product development phases often have great influence on the work environment in the production phase e.g in the form of choice of material assembly methods and choice of surface treatment risk assessments are made of new equipment new processes and changes in the production in advance of the start-up to minimize the risk of accidents and action plans are prepared for areas of improvement which ensure that all new employees and employees on job rotation are introduced to working environment and environment near-miss accidents are registered and analysed to ensure that the risk of future accidents is reduced to the greatest possible extent particularly with focus on prevention there has been extra bang olufsen a/s csr 2013/14 5 focus in the work environment objectives for the financial year on reporting of near-miss accidents and to secure correct attitudes and behaviour of all employees in bang olufsen the number of injuries with absence during the financial year split by white-collar and blue-collar workers is detailed in the graph below the graph also shows the frequency number of accidents per 1 million working hours and the severity number of hours of absence per 1,000 working hours of the industrial injuries 16 0.3 0.25 12 0.2 10 8 0.15 6 0.1 severity number of accidents frequency 14 white-collar

per 1 million working hours and the severity number of hours of absence per 1,000 working hours during the 2013/14 financial year 10 cases of work related injuries which resulted in absence occurred which was above the target the number of days of absence resulting from accidents has generally been low however an accident related to an employee commuting on a train and a case related to an employee commuting on a motorcycle resulted in 17 and 15 days of absence respectively and both have had a significant negative effect on the severity we are currently awaiting national board of industrial injuries decision in these two cases of work related injuries during the 2013/14 financial year we have setup the following activities to reduce the number of work related injuries ÔÇ∑ an environment leader course with focus on leader responsibility and role modeling ÔÇ∑ implemented a new way to conduct work place assessment ÔÇ∑ environmental introduction to all new employees by the environmental department with focus on attitude and behavior ÔÇ∑ implemented a new near-miss on-line portal where all employees can record incident which could course an work accident ÔÇ∑ initiated a `` who is responsible for your safety '' campaign which included mirrors in all factories where employees are prompted to reflect on their own responsibility for improving safety bang olufsen a/s csr 2013/14 6 2.2 external environment it is important to bang olufsen that pollution from the company s activities should be kept to an absolute minimum and that production should not cause any nuisance to the neighbours as a result focus on new projects and follow-up on existing buildings and activities are ongoing the company always enters into dialogue with the regulatory authorities with a view to finding the best solutions and thereby limiting the pollution as much as possible environmental approval under part 5 of the danish environmental protection act milj√∏beskyttelsesloven is required for one bang olufsen factory which is located in struer the environmental approval relates to the surface treatment and mechanical processing of aluminium a licence has also been granted to discharge process waste water to a purification plant attached to the factory no operational accidents occurred in the financial year 2013/14 nor did bang olufsen receive any complaints from neighbours beoenergy is an energy saving project which has been started as bang olufsen wishes to be a green energy-saving company and has an environmental objective to reduce energy consumption in the individual factories beoenergy groups have been set up consisting of our environmental groups and consultancy assistance from the technical department and the environmental department the groups work actively to reduce the energy consumption and have mapped the energy consumption and suggestions have been received on energy saving actions habits and behaviour in relation to energy consumption are specifically monitored the total energy consumption for the struer and herning facilities and the key performance indicator can been seen below 40,000 0.5 0.47 0.45 0.42 mwh 30,000 0.4 0.4 0.37 0.34 0.35 25,000 0.3 20,000 0.25 15,000 0.2 0.15 10,000 0.1 5,000 key performance indicator 35,000 electricity heating kpi 0.05 0 0 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 figure 2 total energy consumption in mwh split by electricity and heat the environmental kpi was reduced by 15 per cent in the 2013/14 financial year compared to 2012/13 and came in 2.9 per cent below the target for the 2013/14 financial year the following activities have contributed to the reduction during the financial year bang olufsen a/s csr 2013/14 7 when a roof was rebuilt after a storm the insulation was improved when changing pumps we bought a new one with a frequency converter to save energy two oil boilers were preserved activities were concentrated in fewer factories the energy consumption has declined by 27 per cent during the last 5 years corresponding to a 24 per cent co2 reduction 2,213 tons co2 3 transportation 3.1 reduced packaging reduces the co2 emission the aim of the packaging is to protect the product during transportation from the factory to the customer insufficient packaging will damage the product and excessive packaging is an environmental problem traditionally bang olufsen has produced packaging for tvs based on a pallet solution this has been necessary as the products are so heavy that they must be handled with a pallet- or fork truck the large packaging gives some practical challenges with the handling at the dealer as it is heavy and unmanageable without lifting aids additionally there is a direct link between the size of the packaging and the environmental load in the form of co2 emission when transporting the products during the 2013/14 financial year bang olufsen has reviewed the company s product packaging with the goal of reducing the company s costs and environmental impact the result of the initiative is a significantly improved end-to-end process for packaging as an example the packaging for newly launched beovision avant now allows for 2 tvs per pallet whereas previous tv models would require one pallet per tv 4 use the result of life cycle analyses of bang olufsen s products shows that the largest environmental load is the energy consumption in the customer s home it has therefore been natural for bang olufsen to among other things focus the environmental effort on reduction of the product s energy consumption 4.1 the products help save energy the energy consumption in the use phase from entertainment electronics is a major environmental load bang olufsen s products are no exception different functionalities have therefore been implemented with a view to reducing the energy consumption the energy consumption of a tv is among other things dependent on the picture on the screen all bang olufsen tvs have an automatic brightness control which means that the light on the screen is automatically adjusted based on the light conditions in the room which reduces the energy consumption when tv is watched in a dark room compared to broad daylight in all of bang olufsen s current tvs an eco mode has been introduced for both sound and picture this is a setting which the customer can opt for which further reduces the energy consumption there is also a function where a warning will appear on screen if a turned on tv hasn t been used for four hours after which the tv automatically will be switched off bang olufsen a/s csr 2013/14 8 today a large number of products use network standby which is a particular form of standby whereby the products can be awakened through an external signal e.g via the customers smartphones in spring eu adopted new regulations for network standby the first regulations will come into force in and bang olufsen s products already meet these the total energy consumption for bang olufsen products sold in the financial year 2013/14 and the average energy consumption can be seen in the graph below 4.2 energy consumption in the use phase the energy consumption in the use phase is a significant environmental condition and is a combination of the products standby usage and the energy consumption during use of the product on mode the graph below shows the total annual energy consumption for the products which bang olufsen has sold in the given financial year and the average annual energy consumption by product 25,000 160 140 120 100 15,000 80 10,000 60 kwh/product mwh

sold bang olufsen products in the financial year 2013/14 and the average energy consumption by product the average energy consumption of bang olufsen s products has increased during the 2013/14 financial year among the various products in bang olufsen s portfolio tv s use more energy than other product categories the energy consumption of tv s and the screen size of tv s are proportional the larger screen size the higher energy consumption in recent years the demand for larger tv screen sizes has increased significantly and as a result bang olufsen have launched more tv s in larger screen sizes in order to meet the demand the sales of bang olufsen s televisions with a screen size of 46 and larger have increased more than 20 percent compared to the financial year 2012/13 which has resulted in an increase of the average energy consumption of the products placed on the market in 2013/2014 bang olufsen a/s csr 2013/14 9 4.3 bang olufsen icepower bang olufsen uses icepower amplifiers in many of the products icepower is a subsidiary of bang olufsen and is a pioneer within class d amplifiers icepower 's amplifiers are different from traditional amplifiers in that they are extremely energy efficient as the amplifiers transform up to 90 per cent of the input effect to output effect traditional amplifiers only transform approximately 20 per cent of the input current to output effect while the remaining 80 per cent is converted to heat in normal use icepower s amplifiers provide a solution which significantly reduces the power consumption at the same time the resource consumption is reduced as materials do not have to be used for cooling fins on the amplifiers to divert the heat bang olufsen s use of icepower amplifiers ensures high sound quality at the same time the environmental load is minimal 5 waste the effort to minimize waste is multifaceted and has the objective to both minimize the amount of waste and secure correct waste sorting the bang olufsen products are constructed to enable disassembly to ensure that as much as possible can be recycled as raw materials in new products 5.1 minimizing waste from production scrap is reusable material left over from production and is made up of aluminium glass tv screens electronics etc with the main part being aluminium scrap can in contrast to a lot of other waste have a considerable financial value it is however even more valuable to reduce the amount of scrap from production when scrap is reduced the raw materials are used more efficiently which is of benefit to both the environment and to the cost of the purchase of new raw material and of production bang olufsen therefore has major focus on minimizing the amount of scrap primarily from aluminium which is an important resource in the production already in the product development phase focus is on optimizing the use of aluminium learnings from production are brought back to the development department to ensure that materials are developed which minimize scrap the amount of scrap has been monitored through a number of years but in the financial year 2013/14 focus has been put on a scrap reduction program which identifies the root causes of the departmental fluctuations and provides mechanisms to improve these the success of the program is secured by a structured management effort and specific solutions which are adapted to the individual departments and which the individual employee is committed to it is important to communicate to both management and employees both in terms of the project s progress and what the individual employee can do to contribute to less scrap in his/her own workplace the 2013/14 financial year showed a 1.9 increase in the amount of scrap which is mainly due to a large amount on new product launches which generally create more scrap in the beginning of the product life cycle than after the production has matured 5.2 disposal of worn-out products electronic scrap is a valuable source for recycling raw materials if it is processed correctly a large part of the world legislation states that worn-out electrical and electronic products have to be collected and processed by an approved waste handler bang olufsen a/s csr 2013/14 10 the product is separated in different material fractions metal pbcs plastic glass and screens which subsequently close the cycle by being reused to produce new raw materials the materials which can not be recycled are as far as possible sent for incineration with the energy being recovered bang olufsen also considers disposal when designing new products for example all plastic components are marked so waste handlers can identify the plastic type involved the european waste electrical and electronic equipment directive weee requires at least 65 per cent of all collected entertainment electronics to be recyclable and a further 10 per cent should be recovered through incineration with energy recovery bang olufsen carries out a dismantling analysis when developing new products to show how the product will be stripped down at disposal what material fractions the product consists of and how much of the product that can be recycled suggestions are also made for design improvements that can be used in future products the dismantling analysis show that in average 80 per cent of the material components in bang olufsen products can be recycled the figure below details recycling and energy consumption for some of the products launched in this financial year beolab receiver beoremote one beolab 19

environmental issues early in the life cycle of the products by imposing extensive environmental demands to the products already at the product development stage these environmental demands are called mandatory requirements and ensure compliance with eu directives and other legislation including reach rohs weee the battery directive and the packaging directive in this way bang olufsen can guarantee that the products leaving the factory comply with local legislation in markets where bang olufsen sells products as a consequence there are mandatory requirements which ensure regulatory compliance but also mandatory requirements outside the scope of the legislation such as plastic softening phthalate c.f the section below 6.2 substitution of chemicals negative list electronic goods contain a

project which on behalf of a number of investors collects information about the efforts of listed companies in relation to reduction of co2 emission in the entire value chain not only is focus on reducing the energy consumption in the production but also on the energy consumption and transportation of the products the employees travelling activities and so on objectives and activities in the area are described under the sections ‚Äò production and ‚Äò use a case in point beovision avant the six phases in bang olufsen s life-cycle approach to csr from suppliers is however best illustrated with a brief case example of our life-cycle approach bang olufsen a/s csr 2013/14 12 during the 2013/2014 financial year bang olufsen launched the new tv beovision avant early in the product development environmental considerations have been applied to the new tv model raw materials suppliers all suppliers to the beovision avant or any other bang olufsen product confirm that they are compliance with the lists of restricted and banned substances i.e rohs when they sign the purchase agreement production and environment from a working environment aspect the beovision avant is easy to assemble and hence the model is easy to strip down into fractions once it becomes waste this feature results in a relatively high recyclability of the product which embraces the idea of resource efficiency transportation from the beginning of the development of the beovision avant packaging has been a key focus area the tv has significantly lower weight than its predecessors e.g like the beovision 7 which reduces the overall energy consumption for transportation in addition the packaging has been designed to allow two tvs per pallet which greatly increased the transportation efficiency use in terms of considerations in regards to the energy consumption beovision avant includes features that reduce the overall energy consumption the tv power down after 4 hours if the consumer has not reacted on a displayed warning furthermore the tv offers power management eco-mode and automatic brightness control features that have the potential to reduce the overall consumption significantly waste the beovision avant is significantly lighter in weight compared to previous generations bang olufsen tv s which reduce the volume of waste fraction that are not possible to recycle

csr activities and objectives in 2015/16 10 csr in bang olufsen the csr policy is supported by bang olufsen 's code of conduct which contains the company s csr requirements to suppliers external audits of the suppliers as well as their sub-suppliers are carried out when there is a concrete suspicion of breach of the code of conduct the bang olufsen logo is a quality guarantee as it has been since the company was established in 1925 this is not only related to delivering products of high quality to the customers but also related to the way the business is run bang olufsen recognises the un and ilo declarations regarding human rights labour rights environment and anti-corruption and has therefore chosen to structure the csr work including the csr policy in accordance with the un global compact guidelines bang olufsen works systematically with csr and is certified in accordance with iso 9001 quality management ts16949 technical standard for quality within the automotive industry iso 14.001 environmental management and ohsas 18.001 work environment management the management systems contribute to ensure that the efforts are concentrated in the areas with main potential for improvement bang olufsen a/s bang olufsen 's procurement department has a set of moral and ethics guidelines which include internal anticorruption guidelines for e.g gift exchange negotiation principles and handling of conflicts of interest the internal anti-corruption guidelines have been extended to include the sales organisation which is especially relevant for new markets where bang olufsen is currently expanding the business to support the guidelines bang olufsen has set up a whistle-blower function which is an externally run hotline to which the employees anonymously can report unethical behaviour csr 2014/15 2 bang olufsen s csr policy bang olufsen s csr policy states the guidelines for the corporate social responsibility activities within the framework of the bang olufsen group bang olufsen aims to ensure compliance both within its own organization as well as for partners and suppliers human rights bang olufsen aims in all matters within the group's control to support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights employee rights bang olufsen aims to show the greatest degree of social responsibility towards our employees bang olufsen supports the abolition of child labour and forced labour and condemns discrimination in employment and occupation bang olufsen attaches great importance to freedom of association and recognizes the right to collective bargaining bang olufsen aims to be a tolerant workplace where each employee thrives and has the possibility to develop and create a good work-life balance bang olufsen a/s anti-corruption bang olufsen strongly disassociates itself from all kinds of corruption including extortion and bribery environment and climate bang olufsen has an integrated thinking with regard to the environmental consequences our production and products have on our employees customers and surroundings we use the word `` environment '' broadly to cover the disciplines of work environment product environment and external environment as a responsible company bang olufsen aims to create sustainable products the considerations involved in the operation design and longevity of our products must be in mutual balance with the environmental impact of production bang olufsen complies with existing legislation in the countries where we produce and sell our products more specifically we aim to focus on the areas where the right balance between effort and impact can be achieved ÔÇ∑ improve the work environment and the health and safety conditions of our employees ÔÇ∑ prevent work related illnesses and/or injuries ÔÇ∑ improve and prevent negative environmental impact from our production and products including reduction of climate impact csr 2014/15 3 csr work and results in 2014/15 bang olufsen works with corporate social responsibility within the framework of the product lifecycle as the environment is considered a closed lifecycle where waste is a resource which can be recycled in new products 1 materials 5 disposal 4 use 2 manufacturing 3 transportation comply to at the same time the direct suppliers guarantee that their sub-suppliers comply with the same guidelines and demands once a year a risk analysis is made of bang olufsen s suppliers and the efforts are hereafter focused on suppliers with a high risk of violating the code of conduct these suppliers are subsequently audited to uncover the possibilities for improving the conditions during the 2014/15 financial year four audits were conducted and followed up and for 2015/16 two to five new audits are expected the work with responsible supplier management is a continuous process the intention is therefore not to use the code of conduct to terminate the cooperation with the supplier if an audit reveals critical deviations instead the company will initiate cooperation on action plans to improve the supplier s environmental and social standards 2 manufacturing 1 materials the bang olufsen design is timeless and includes simple and genuine materials which have recyclability potential bang olufsen commits to continuously update software on the consumers products which allows the bang olufsen products to be long-lasting in addition there is still a large demand for older bang olufsen products and the market for used bang olufsen products is relatively large which contributes to strengthening the bang olufsen brand as attractive high-quality products with a long lifetime 1.1 responsible supplier management bang olufsen makes an active effort to ensure that no suppliers use child labour forced labour or unnecessarily overload the environment to produce bang olufsen products or components the agent in this relation is called responsible supplier management which bang olufsen started to use 10 years ago as part of the work with responsible supplier management bang olufsen has set up a code of conduct which the company s values in central areas such as environment and climate human rights labour rights and anti- corruption are explained to suppliers bang olufsen 's code of conduct partly builds on the ten principles in the un global compact and partly on the un conventions on human rights the production and the environmental impact is a particularly important csr focus point for bang olufsen it is divided into product- work- and external environment ÔÇ∑ product environment is the environmental conditions that are attached to the company s products e.g energy consumption in the use phase ÔÇ∑ work environment is the health and safety conditions under which the employees work ÔÇ∑ external environment is the environmental conditions that are related to the company s own production e.g raw material usage electricity consumption heat consumption water consumption and waste bang olufsen s danish activities have been environmentally certified iso 14.001 and the working environment certified ohsas 18.001 since the audit conclusion from the certifying body was generally speaking we are enthusiastic for what we see out in the areas there is a broad environmental awareness among managers employees and the environmental organisation. no non-conformities were raised during the audit in march all direct suppliers to bang olufsen must sign the code of conduct and thereby accept the requirements that bang olufsen expects the individual suppliers to bang olufsen a/s csr 2014/15 4 in 2014/15 bang olufsen had particular focus on ergonomic and heavy lift in the early phase of our product production new lifting equipment was developed and implemented in the development department and the installation videos show how heavy products can be handled by lifting and in an ergonomic way to ensure bang olufsen is a good and attractive company to work for it is essential that the employees thrive in their job work with interesting and challenging tasks and that management also provides guidance and support when needed 2.1 product environment sustainable product design is essential for meeting the objectives of a sustainable future where resource efficiency and zero-waste policies are on top of the global environmental policy agenda sustainable design features can extend the products life time and design for re-use takes into account the disposal of the products by using simple materials with high recycling potential sustainable design features in bang olufsen s products help the consumers to separate themselves from the take-make-dispose culture bang olufsen has a list of undesirable substances substances on this list are legal to use but are under suspicion of being harmful therefore bang olufsen has chosen to phase them out for instance bang olufsen prohibited the use of all brominated flameretardants already in the 1990 s but only in 2006 did two types these become banned by european regulation moreover bang olufsen began to phase out phthalates in wires that comes into prolonged contact with the skin in today all bang olufsen headphones are phthalate-free 2.2 work environment bang olufsen puts great emphasis on creating a safe and healthy work environment for the employees with focus on improving both the physical and psychological work environment the objective is to make every day work life healthier and to encourage the employees to share the responsibility for their own health and safety the work environment is considered already in the product design and development phase as choices in the early product development phases often have great influence on the work environment in the production phase e.g in the form of choice of material assembly methods and choice of surface treatment bang olufsen a/s bang olufsen has defined roles responsibilities and activities for each group of employees managers and employees are trained in how to handle a colleague or an employee who is not feeling well policy on the promotion of well-being and stress management among our employees ÔÇ∑ bang olufsen endeavours to provide a healthy psychological work environment in which employees thrive ÔÇ∑ bang olufsen wants to strengthen the factors that promote the satisfaction motivation and commitment of our employees ÔÇ∑ bang olufsen considers stress a serious issue ÔÇ∑ bang olufsen recognises that there are many factors that can affect the general well-being of an employee and that work-related and personal factors can all play a part we will therefore raise awareness among managers employees and colleagues alike and make a plan of action and a `` toolbox '' available for the promotion of wellbeing and the prevention and management of stress the number of injuries with absence during the financial year split in white-collar and blue-collar workers is detailed in the graph below the graph also shows the frequency number of accidents per 1 million working hours and the severity number of hours of absence per 1,000 working hours of the industrial injuries work environment 2014/15 frequency severity

accidents per 1 million working hours and the severity number of hours of absence per 1,000 working hours during the 2014/15 financial year bang olufsen had 11 cases of work related injuries 4 in the czech republic and 7 in denmark which resulted in absence the number of days of absence resulting from accidents has generally been low 1 to 4 days however one accident in denmark and three accidents in the czech republic have resulted in 14 31 days of absence all four have had a significant negative effect on the overall severity accidents analysis ÔÇ∑ 90 per cent of all accidents occur in the production in denmark and the czech republic which is therefore also the key focus areas ÔÇ∑ 90 per cent of all accidents are caused by individual carelessness and wrong attitude and not caused by lack of safety equipment ÔÇ∑ 50 per cent of all accidents are caused where people cut themselves on product items or fall as a result of jumping or slipping on the floor workshop for all managers in the danish production which will be cascaded by managers through similar session to the employees the goal is to evaluate the department for risks with focus on sharp items risk of falling and individual carelessness and wrong attitude besides ongoing initiatives actions and target for 2015/16 have been set to reduce the number of accidents 2.3 external environment bang olufsen seeks to keep pollution as well as nuisance to neighbours from the company s activities to an absolute minimum therefore there is continuous focus and follow up on new projects and existing buildings and activities the company always enters into dialogue with the regulatory authorities with an aim to find the best solutions and thereby minimising pollution as much as possible environmental approval under part 5 of the danish environmental protection act milj√∏beskyttelsesloven is required for one bang olufsen factory which is located in struer the environmental approval relates to the surface treatment and mechanical processing of aluminium a licence has also been granted to discharge process waste water to a purification plant attached to the factory no environmental accidents occurred in the financial year 2014/15 nor did bang olufsen receive any complaints from neighbours conclusion on the environmental inspection in 2014/15 from the local authority bang olufsen works diligently with environmental conditions and complies with the demands which are written in the company s environmental approval to address the number of accidents in 2014/15 we have conducted a thorough accident analysis and based on the results set up additional activities to reduce the number of work related injuries bang olufsen seeks to be a sustainable company and has therefore set common goal for energy consumption in the production in denmark and the czech republic the total energy consumption and the key performance indicator can been seen below ÔÇ∑ energy consumption 2014/15 safety walk in the production in denmark and in the czech republic the manager tours the production to engage in a dialogue with employees regarding safety and health the intention is to focus on right and wrong conduct and to provide clear leadership and management focus and commitment towards health and safety issues bang olufsen a/s energy consumption target actual 0.34 0.35 note kpi kwh/earned wages csr 2014/15 6

kpi kwh/earned wages the environmental kpi increased by 0.8 per cent in the 2014/15 financial year compared to 2013/14 and came in 1.5 per cent above the target the following activities have been initiated during the financial year a generator has been switched off resulting in a saving of 44,000 kwh per year five transformers have been disconnected resulting in a saving of 50,000 kwh a year luminous discharge lamps in elevators have been changed to led resulting in a saving of 2,000 kwh a year behavior related such as regulating temperature limit in winter and summer air leak repair lowering of temperature of water in boilers and switching off lines/areas when finished the energy consumption has declined by 24 per cent during the last 5 years corresponding to a 28 per cent co2 a reduction of 3,396 tons co2 over the last eight years bang olufsen has reported to the carbon disclosure project which on behalf of a number of investors collects information about the efforts of listed companies in relation to reduction of co2 emission in the entire value chain this does not only focus on reducing the energy consumption in the production but also on the energy consumption and transportation of the products the employees travelling activities etc 3 transportation 3.1 reduced packaging reduces the co2 emission the aim of the packaging is to protect the product during transportation from the factory to the customer bang olufsen a/s bang olufsen seeks to optimise materials and resources for the product packaging and design it to allow as many products on one pallet as possible to avoid the environmental impacts related to inefficient transport of products the result of the initiative is a significantly improved end-to-end process for packaging as an example the packaging for newly launched beovision avant now allows for two tvs per pallet whereas previous tv models would require one pallet per tv 4 use the energy consumption in the use phase from electronics is a major environmental load bang olufsen s products are no exception different functionalities have therefore been implemented with an aim of managing and reducing the energy consumption the energy consumption of a tv is among other things dependent on the picture on the screen all bang olufsen tvs have an automatic brightness control which reduces the energy consumption when tv is being watched in a dark room compared to broad daylight automatic brightness control our eyes constantly adjust automatically to lighting conditions without us noticing bang olufsen s automatic picture control brings this to your television there 's a large difference between watching daytime news in a room flooded with light and cosying up in front of a movie in the dark bang olufsen television adapts seamlessly to these different conditions constantly adjusting its image to avoid strain on the eyes all of bang olufsen s current tvs also have energy saving functionality for both sound and picture called an eco mode this is a setting which the customer can chose to reduce the products energy consumption in addition the tvs also include a function where a warning will appear on screen if a turned on tv hasn t been used for four hours after which the tv automatically will be switched off the energy consumption in the use phase is a combination of the products standby usage and the energy consumption during use of the product the graph below shows the total annual energy consumption for the products which bang olufsen csr 2014/15 7 has sold in the given financial year and the average annual energy consumption by product reduction of 10.7 per cent compared with the target of 5.0 per cent reduction the result was achieved by an intensive focus from both management and employees bang olufsen s aluminum production figure 3 product energy consumption 20,000 120 18,000 14,000 80 mwh 12,000 10,000 60 8,000 kwh/product 100 16,000 40 6,000 4,000 20 2,000 0 0 mwh kwh/product figure 3 the diagram shows the total annual energy consumption for all sold bang olufsen products in the financial year 2014//15 and the average energy consumption by product the average energy consumption of a bang olufsen product placed on the market during the 2014/15 financial year has decreased due to an increased share of in sales of b o play products the increase in the total energy consumption is the result of the general increase in sales 5 disposal the effort to minimize waste is multifaceted and has the objective to both minimize the amount of waste and secure correct waste sorting the bang olufsen products are constructed to enable disassembly to ensure that as much as possible can be recycled as raw materials in new products ÔÇ∑ ÔÇ∑ ÔÇ∑ ÔÇ∑ for decades bang olufsen has used aluminum as a significant design element aluminum is the third most abundant element in the earth 's crust aluminum is easily recycled and recycling aluminum reduces the energy consumption for melting with 95 per cent bang olufsen in 2014/15 reduced the waste related to processing aluminum with 10.7 per cent 5.2 disposal of worn-out products electronic scrap is a valuable source for recycling raw materials if it is processed correctly a large part of the world legislation states that worn-out electrical and electronic products have to be collected and processed by an approved waste handler 5.1 minimizing waste from production scrap is reusable material left over from production when scrap is reduced the raw materials are used more efficiently which is of benefit to both the environment and to the cost of the purchase of new raw material and of production bang olufsen carries out a dismantling analysis when developing new products to evaluate how the product can be stripped down at disposal what material fractions the product consists of and how much of the product that can be recycled the dismantling analysis show that in average 76 per cent of the materials in bang olufsen products has the potential to be recycled bang olufsen therefore has high focus on minimizing the amount of scrap both in the design phase of a product and during running production the figure below details recyclability and energy recovery for a selection of products launched in this financial year the scrap reduction program started last year continued during 2014/15 with focus at reducing scrap of aluminium the program identifies the root causes and provides mechanisms for improvements the result of the scrap reduction program 2014/15 was a bang olufsen a/s csr 2014/15 8 figure 4 recyclability

products bring the customer and through our skillsets and expertise in banking the group aims to create social value through community involvement it is our assertion that csr initiatives will yield the best results if there is a natural connection between such activities and the group s business strategy and core competences therefore our initiatives are strategically rooted in the group s vision strategy and values given the group s historically strong commitment to community involvement and the desire to make a positive difference for our customers and employees banknordik s approach is centred on these three pillars ‚ñ†‚ñ† customers ‚ñ†‚ñ† employees ‚ñ†‚ñ† local community it is important that the group s csr-initiatives are to-the-point effective and relevant for our role as a financial institution in the north atlantic region this translates into measurable aspects that take into consideration the social and cultural structures embedded within the communities where banknordik is present engaging in long-term customer relationships the group s core values and vision evolve around the aspiration to retain our existing customers for the long term and to attract new customers by being proactive competent and fully committed we find it natural that the group s corporate responsibility efforts are in conjunction with our customer-centred approach to further strengthen confidence in our way of conducting business as such the customer is one of the main three pillars of our csr-programme financial advice that everyone understands banknordik s promise to its customers is to provide individualised consultation that makes it easier to take the right financial decisions delivering on this promise requires a high level of competence and we therefore strive to continuously train and certify our advisors to be able to provide comprehendible tailored advice that will allow our customers to take control of their own finances encouraging healthy finances banknordik promotes responsible financial behaviour and decision-making because we know that healthy personal finances are important to an individual s well-being and when our customers take responsibility for their own finances it benefits both parties this motivation is extended through the group s communication channels and forms a specific part of the bank s social media strategy to produce valuable information and know-how that is comprehendible to all our customers and followers click to see our faroese danish and greenlandic facebook pages in early banknordik launched a new

for us to attract and develop a qualified workforce in order to strengthen the group s competitiveness we recognise the importance of building a working environment that aligns to the need of the individual and for our employees to maintain a healthy work-life balance in addition the group continuously seeks to arrange employee development programmes social events and other initiatives that contribute to strengthening our corporate culture and nurturing better business performance satisfied employees do great work an important part of this process is to preserve a high level of overall job satisfaction amongst our employees in banknordik introduced a new annual employee engagement survey which encourages respondents to provide feedback on a series of organisational parameters the survey provides meaningful insights into the strength of our corporate culture and builds an understanding and connection to company values and goals and areas within the organisation that should be prioritised in the future the survey was carried out by an independent third party and banknordik scored 3.9 on a scale of 1 lowest to 5 highest this is considered a satisfactory result which will form a basis of comparison for next years survey upholding a diverse gender balance the group 's main consideration in relation to the composition of management positions is to ensure staffing by people who possess the best qualifications within their respective fields it is therefore paramount to uphold an open and inclusive workplace culture to fully utilise the entire talent pool and support a diverse workforce in the pursuit of better business performance as such each of banknordik s employees regardless of gender is encouraged to leverage his or her skills and freely seek career advancements with equal opportunities in an industry where gender balance is a general challenge we are pleased that 40 of the group s leadership positions were held by women at year-end which is consistent with our ambition to not underrepresent either gender by a wider margin than 40 vs. 60 a skilled workforce represents the fuel that drives the engine of business at the banknordik group we understand that employee development is critical to continued successful business results therefore we constantly work to develop our human resources and improve the future prospects of our employees each year banknordik invests in trainee programmes enrolls employees in academic business courses and arranges on-site training and team-building activities in addition to strengthening the skills and

throughout its history banknordik has consistently acquired artwork created by local artists over time the group s acquisitions have grown to a significant collection of historical art pieces created by prominent faroese painters however as the bank s branch network has been reduced in recent decades in step with the adaption of new technology our activities now occupy considerably fewer locations as a consequence the art collection which was previously spread amongst a large branch network has become less widespread and not as accessible to the public for the sake of securing the part of the art collection which has not been available to the public in recent years banknordik has established an independent trust ‚Äî the banknordik trust ‚Äî to take ownership of over 600 works of art the trust s objectives are as follows ‚ñ†‚ñ† take ownership and develop the art collection ‚ñ†‚ñ† arrange exhibitions and lend out artworks ‚ñ†‚ñ† partner with public and private institutions to promote faroese art ‚ñ†‚ñ† develop the faroese art scene in addition to entrusting the art collection which has an estimated value of dkk 5m banknordik has committed dkk 1m to fund the trust in the period up to 2020 the appointed board of directors is responsible for all of the trust s operations including for generating revenue from exhibits lending out artworks and through contributions corporate social responsibility report page 5 policies and standards even though the banknordik group supports and abides by the intentions and principles of international initiatives and frameworks such as the un global compact the group chooses not to formally comply with such standards due to our locally placed activities for the same reason the group has not formally incorporated environmental or human

the finished product and it is therefore critical for the company and its success that we have built-in responsibility for every stage of the process as from the financial year companies are obliged to give an outline of their corporate social responsibility csr under the annual accounts act hence bavarian nordic has prepared this report which forms part of the management commentary as underwritten by the board and corporate management on 9 march we define our work on social responsibility on the basis of a number of interest groups and will initially focus on the environment employees and suppliers eventually we will assess whether it is appropriate to involve other interest groups gathering existing objectives and policies in an overall strategy we have no formal overall policy on social responsibility but for some years now we have worked on specific objectives and policies in a number of different yet relevant fields the aim is to bring these goals and policies together in a comprehensive policy on csr which will become an integral part of the company s overall strategy and which we shall look at regularly and adjust if need be 1 http //www.globalreporting.org the objectives we are working on are a natural extension of existing activities that are relevant to our social responsibility we aim to ensure that all conditions reported on directly or indirectly are of relevant commercial importance to the future development of the company the primary theme of our report is the environment which is based on our research of the environment using the green accounts submitted since 2005 when the production facility in the kvistg√•rd came into use besides environmental issues we have chosen to concentrate on matters relating to employees and suppliers structure of the report the preparation of the report is inspired by elements in the global reporting initiative gri 1 which is a recognised framework for reports on sustainability the gri structure sets out principles and indicators used to measure and explain financial environmental and social performances bavarian nordic has offices and facilities in six different locations in the world spread over four countries local differences in the requirements for and recording of statistics on environmental concerns working hours absences etc make it a challenge to carry out a consistent adequate and accurate reporting across the group of the areas we have chosen to include in the report for this reason the report focuses primarily on our two largest facilities kvistg√•rd in denmark and martinsried in germany we are continuously working on harmonising methods and principles to ensure quantifiable statistics for the entire group in the

responsibility environment the environment plays a major role in bavarian nordic and has been an important focus for the company ever since the establishment of the production facility in kvistg√•rd in designing the plant in kvistg√•rd the company focused on reducing environmental impact and the company has since worked to introduce cleaner technologies through the development and adaptation of technology already in use including the reduction of the environmental impact by reducing energy consumption and use of accessory agents print which details the emission of greenhouse gases c02 of the company s two largest facilities in kvistg√•rd and martinsried since the initial operation of the production facility in 2005 we have published the ‚Äò green accounts once a year these give an outline of the environmental conditions in the company including among other things an inventory of energy and water consumption and emissions and waste at the kvistg√•rd facility the green accounts are compiled according to order by the danish ministry of the environment and can be found on the company website the first real mapping of energy consumption took place at our facilities in kvistg√•rd denmark and martinsried germany which house research and quality laboratories administration and production in total these two facilities engage around 80 of all employees in bavarian nordic from the year we have decided to integrate parts of the green accounts in the corporate social responsibility report to this end we have developed a climate account ‚Äò carbon foot- carbon footprint the company s climate account ‚Äò carbon footprint has been calculated for and will be included in the corporate social responsibility report in the future the climate account presents the company s energy consumption and resulting emissions expressed in tonnes of co2 and covers several gri indicators up to now bavarian nordic has not established a proper target for reducing its c02 emissions but is working on reducing future relative emissions since the company expects an increase in production at the facility in kvistg√•rd over the coming years and has not at present compiled the co2

employees but is also a responsibility to encourage the social interactivity between employees and employee groups in the areas of effort in kvistg√•rd have been focused on the improvement of cleaning procedures conditions of meetingrooms and the dining area and draught nuisance in administrative areas at bavarian nordic we place focus on wholeness and aim at ensuring a good and healthy balance between work and leisure time in kvistg√•rd all employees are covered by health insurance which secures fast and professional help and treatment in private hospitals appointments with psychologists chiropractors and physiotherapists etc. should the need arise at the workplace we hold seminars on stress management and we have been actively engaged for several years in dialoguebased interviews with employees who have prolonged absences due to sickness these interviews ensure a fast but gentle and individually-focused return to work social activities are an important component of a balanced life backed by the management an active employee club in kvistg√•rd currently launches new initiatives to meet the various interests of the employees a safe and good working environment we must always ensure that employees can perform their work without risking life or limb and we are continuously working on optimising safety at work in we had 9 minor accidents corresponding to an accident rate of 15.03 for the entire company4 in the accident rate among danish companies was 25.15 out of the 9 accidents 7 of them occurred among employees in production these are primarily minor injuries which do not relate to the execution of the job and only one employee had more than 3 days related absence 3 the accident rate expresses the number of accidents per million man-hours 4 the number applies to the entire bavarian nordic group areas of effort for kvistg√•rd in are as follows carrying out regular working environment inspections uncomfortable working postures in production group qc group and engineering group noise survey of working conditions and action plan if necessary investigation of fall injuries and action plan if necessary objective our objective remains to minimise the number of accidents at work through preventive measures with special focus on the areas where most accidents occur absence in the overall absence in bavarian nordic reached an average of 10 days per employee equivalent to an absence rate of 4.9 6 which is lower than the average for the pharmaceutical industry which lies at 6.7 figures 7 at present the registration of absences at the company 's various locations is not standardised across the group these local differences mean that the overall picture of registered absences is unclear the aim for is to develop uniform guidelines and to implement an effective system for the registration of absences across the group so in we shall have one standardised system 5 confederation of danish industry accidents at work business statistics objective in the coming years the aim of the company is to develop uniform guidelines and implement an effective system for registration of absences across the group personal and organisational development development opportunities are not only important to ensure recruitment and retention of qualified employees but also mean that the employees can realise their full potential thereby ensuring the company 's competitiveness it is imperative that our employees have the necessary tools to solve tasks in a competent manner now and in the future we have annual employee development interviews which we 6 includes employees in kvistg√•rd martinsried and berlin 7 confederation of danish industry absence statistics corporate social responsibility 9 follow up on and adapt according to current needs naturally we comply with the high standards of ongoing education and the updating of qualifications under trade regulations national laws and agreements but our objective does not state a number of training hours per employee for us the objective is that employees and managers as a minimum have the competency to apply for and get their own jobs at any time objective we will explore the possibility of setting up a central system for registration of activities relating to continuing education and updating of qualifications 10 corporate social responsibility suppliers as an integral part of bavarian nordic 's policy on social responsibility we wish to develop a set of guidelines for our relationship with suppliers of raw materials in accordance with good manufacturing practice gmp and bavarian nordic s existing supplier management all suppliers of raw materials are subject to inspections audits before final agreements are concluded thus the company is well positioned to influence the suppliers own commitment to socially responsible activities today looking at conditions relating to social responsibility is not a part of the already comprehensive inspections that take place but will be integrated into future reviews of both existing and new suppliers it is our objective in to establish assessment criteria for our suppliers in we will integrate the principles of social responsibility into the purchasing function on the basis of these assessment criteria the aim is to have a data base that can form the basis for reporting of supplier conditions in the annual report for spring this will ensure that the guidelines become an important integral part of our relationship with sup- pliers the intention is to implement the new guidelines in the assessment of all relevant and major suppliers on the basis of these assessments bavarian nordic can subsequently indicate where improvements are needed in order to encourage a `` best practice '' approach in close cooperation based on communication and education objective in we wish to set a goal of establishing a system to assess suppliers of raw materials in relation to social responsibility including environmental conditions corporate social responsibility 11 auditor s report to the group management of bavarian nordic a/s we have performed a review of bavarian nordic s report on corporate social responsibility the report the purpose of our review was to submit a statement here on the management of the company is responsible for the report our responsibility is to provide a conclusion based on our review of the report the performed review we have performed our review in accordance with the danish auditing standard on assurance engagements rs 3000 assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information it has been our purpose to obtain limited assurance that the data at group level presented in the report are in accordance with the described reporting practice and information reported to headquarters from production sites and other business units by agreement we have reviewed data at kvistgaard on a sample basis but we have not reviewed the data at other production sites and business units our review is based on an evaluation of risk of material errors we have evaluated the reporting practice and analyzed correlations with the company s activities the review is limited to first of all include inquiries from management and employees as well as analytical procedures and a limited level of assurance is thus lower than the assurance which would have been obtained if we had performed an audit conclusion during our review nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that the data at group level overall are not in accordance with the described reporting principles and practice and information reported from production sites and other business units copenhagen 9 march deloitte statsautoriseret revisionsaktieselskab preben j. s√∏rensen state-authorised public accountant 12 corporate social responsibility reporting principles and practice the csr report has been prepared in accordance with the annual accounts act which requires companies to give an outline of their corporate social responsibility the preparation of the report is inspired by elements in the global reporting initiative gri which is a recognised framework for reports on sustainability the gri structure sets out principles and indicators used to measure and explain financial environmental and social performances the gri framework is not a check list but we use it as inspiration in our continued reporting process the reporting scope has been defined by a principle of materiality thereby we strive to include the most significant issues where our company directly or indirectly impacts on the surroundings our production is one of the primary sources of environmental impact from our company through the carbon footprint calculation included in this report and our green accounts which are published once a year we aim for transparency in our reporting on environmental issues our production and derived activities quality control etc are also the primary consumer of raw materials and thus we regard it as relevant to include the supply chain in our report today looking at conditions relating to social responsibility is not a part of the already comprehensive inspections that take place but will be integrated into future reviews of both existing and new suppliers being the first csr report from bavarian nordic it has not been possible to integrate all company facilities in all ratio calculations either due to data unavailability or because inventory methods vary from country to country therefore we have in this first report chosen to focus primarily on our two largest facilities in kvistg√•rd and martinsried with almost 180 employees kvistg√•rd accounts for more than half of all the group s employees and covers our industrial manufacturing facility quality laboratories technical service and administration martinsried is our centre of research and development and employs approximately 100 employees carbon footprint the carbon footprint has been calculated using the standard and recommendations for calculating a company s total set of greenhouse gas emissions issued by the greenhouse gas protocol initiative this includes the six gases designated in the kyoto protocol co2 ch4 n2o hfcs pfcs and sf6 and is expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide the emission sources are divided into three scopes that include direct emissions from activities controlled by the company scope 1 emissions from use of electricity scope 2 and indirect emissions from products and services scope 3 according to the recommendations companies should separately account for and report on scopes 1 and 2 at a minimum and this is what we have done in this report establishing a base we have calculated the total carbon emission from our facilities in kvistg√•rd and martinsried with regard to establishing a base for four different types of emission consumption of natural gas and oil the figure is based on the current consumption according to monthly readings greenhouse gas emission from combustion of fossil fuels is calculated on the basis of an average emission factor refrigerant leakage this is calculated leakage from refrigeration systems according to the refill log greenhouse gases included in this statement cover the six gases designated in the kyoto protocol co2 ch4 n2o hfcs pfcs and sf6 electricity consumption consumption of electricity based on meter readings at the end of greenhouse gas emission from electricity consumption is calculated on the basis of specific emission factors from the energy supplier and an average emission factor for production of electricity in germany mileage the figure is derived from petrol station receipts and covers both company owned as well as leased vehicles greenhouse gas emission is calculated on the basis of an average fuel specific emission factor for ordinary cars in denmark and germany absence reports of absence for cover only bavarian nordic s employees in kvistg√•rd martinsried and berlin and include records of employees own absences due to illness sick children hospital visits and admissions and absences due to work accidents leave of absence including maternity leave is not included in the calculation when calculating the absence rate the following is applied the average annual number of full-time employees multiplied by the number of workdays divided by the number of total days of absence accidents the report on accidents at work covers the whole bavarian nordic group and includes accidents which result in more than 1 day 's absence when calculating the accident rate the following is applied the total number of man-hours in the group in calculated on the basis of the average annual number of full-time employees multiplied by the number of annual man-hours holidays are not included"

pharmaceutical industry works according to the rules of good manufacturing practice or gmp gmp includes strict requirements with respect to a product s traceability strength quality and purity which means that quality control has to be built into each step of the manufacturing process gmp rules are laid down by the danish european and american health authorities bavarian nordic supplies these markets and thus complies with these quality requirements product safety is crucial in our business and quality and responsibility have been built into our systems and our entire corporate culture as a result of a targeted effort initiated in to systematise our work with corporate social responsibility csr we now have an actual general csr policy which includes policies in the areas we have deemed vital to our work report structure this csr report is part of the annual report s management statement as signed and approved by the board of directors and corporate management on 10 march 1 protection against biological terrorism 2 http //www.globalreporting.org this is the second csr report to be issued by the company so it includes a follow-up on the goals we set for ourselves in just like last year s document this csr report was inspired by elements from the global reporting initiative gri 2 a recognised framework for reports on sustainability the gri structure includes principles and indicators used to measure and explain financial environmental and social performance we have added more gri indicators to this csr report and will also in future strive to expand our reporting but only in those fields which are directly or indirectly related to the future development of the company s business and activities we have defined our work with social responsibility on the basis of a number of stakeholder groups and will as we did in continue to concentrate on the environment our employees and our suppliers we take our starting point in our previous environmental reporting which has been in the form of the green accounts we have published since 2005 when our production facility in the town of kvistg√•rd opened going forward we will look at whether it is relevant to include other stakeholders bavarian nordic has offices and facilities in six different locations across four different countries local differences in statistical methods and regulatory requirements regarding data on environment health and safety working hours absence etc make it difficult to provide uniform reporting across the group within certain of the areas we include in this report we worked on this challenge in and as a result we were able to include more of our facilities in this report but we also found that we had to make minor changes to the methods used in some of our calculations the

separate category csr policies 5 csr policies we have most recently drafted corporate social responsibility csr policies in these policies are a natural extension of the goals and targets we work towards as a company our goals in the environment health and safety field are specified in greater detail in our environmental and occupational health and safety policies general csr policy bavarian nordic develops and manufactures vaccines for the prevention and treatment of life-threatening diseases where there are as yet unmet needs in doing so we seek to create a continuing business that will ensure the company s growth and investment in research and development and thus continue to contribute to a healthier and safer society at the same time we focus on working and acting responsibly with respect to the world we live in we aim to do this by environmental policy at bavarian nordic we design our vaccine production facilities and procedures so that there is no risk of viruses escaping into the indoor or outdoor environment not into via through the air our waste or our wastewater we at bavarian nordic work continually on improving our environmental efforts our efforts to improve the environment and minimise our environmental impact our aims are manufacturing high-quality vaccines working actively to minimise our impact on the environment and climate maintaining an active dialogue with our stakeholders on a local national and global level providing a safe and healthy working environment for our staff that includes opportunities for professional and personal development communicating our csr policy to external collaboration partners including our suppliers to encourage environmentally aware behaviour and prevent contamination and pollution throughout the company to reduce our environmental impact by developing and using processes that have a minimum of environmental impact optimising our utilisation of materials and energy reducing emissions and waste to comply with environmental protection regulations and relevant requirements to gradually build an environmental management system based on the principles in the iso 14001 standard health and safety a safe and healthy working environment is important for employee safety and satisfaction at the workplace we always comply with the applicable rules and regulations in this field and focus on systematically mapping both physical and mental working environment so that the necessary preventive steps can be taken for the benefit of individual employees as well as the company as a whole the aims of our general health and safety policy are to promote awareness of health- and safety-related behaviour in all staff as part of their day-to-day work and work towards proactive solutions to potential problems to gradually develop a management system to facilitate this proactive safety work suppliers policy we do not as yet have an actual suppliers policy on social responsibility instead we have laid out a policy for the communication of our position on social responsibility to our suppliers 6 environment environment the environment is important to us at bavarian nordic when we built our factory in the danish town of kvistg√•rd in 2005 we had a great deal of focus on reducing our environmental impact since then we have continually been working to minimise our environmental impact and to actively incorporate environmental health and safety planning into our building projects since our kvistg√•rd factory began operations in 2005 we have published annual ‚Äò green accounts containing environment-related information that includes data on the kvistg√•rd facility 's energy and water consumption emissions and waste these green accounts are prepared in accordance with danish law and can be downloaded from the bavarian nordic website we implemented a number of environmental savings in among other things we replaced an older oversized steam boiler with two smaller boilers better suited to the needs of our production facility a project to build a new process laboratory has also begun part of the planning involves looking at possible water and energy savings in the larger-scale process equipment relevant measures will be implemented as planning progresses we are also aware of the importance of maintaining a good dialogue with our neighbours when bavarian nordic established a presence in kvistg√•rd we invited our neighbours to an information meeting just as our neighbours and the public in general were involved through two consultation exercises held in connection with the environmental assessment process we also completed several projects based on suggestions from our carbon footprint calculated for and mountain kvistg√•rd martinsried berlin view

and thus deviate from the figures stated in the report ** part of the electrical power and heating consumption figure for berlin is estimated some of the rooms of this facility are part of a larger building used by several businesses and heating and power consumption is charged only indirectly as part of the rent an estimated total figure was however calculated based on metered energy consumption from the facility s other building *** estimate based on oil deliveries made every five years this estimate was not included in the report neighbours in our daily work we are occasionally in contact with our neighbours especially in matters to do with noise which is what affects them most directly also because of this contact we are aware of the impact we can have in connection with both our production and our construction projects we have decided to integrate parts of our green accounts into our csr report and to that end have prepared a 'carbon footprint' statement that specifies our greenhouse gas carbon emissions carbon footprint we have prepared carbon footprint statements for and a carbon footprint statement specifies the energy consumed by the company and its emissions expressed in tonnes of co2 tco2 and it includes several gri indicators in our statement the carbon footprint was calculated only for the company s largest facilities i.e kvistg√•rd and martinsried the carbon footprint statement for includes two more berlin and mountain view these four facilities employ a total of just over 98 of all bavarian nordic staff and presumably account for most of the group 's energy consumption by far as our other sites are only small office facilities table 1 shows the co2 emissions calculated for bavarian nordic for and greenhouse gas emissions in totalled approximately 3400 tonnes of co2 versus roughly 2600 tonnes in the increase is partly due to the fact that the mountain view and berlin facilities are included in the calculations but it is also due to increases of 16 and 11 in emissions from kvistg√•rd and martinsried respectively kvistg√•rd s increase is due to a slight rise in production the start-up of a new quality control laboratory a larger number of staff employed and more electrical power used due to building activities the increase at martinsried is the result of a few cold months at the beginning and end of the year raising heating consumption as well as more electrical equipment at the site the total emissions figure of 3400 tonnes of co2 corresponds to the emissions produced by roughly 260 danish households3 3 environment 7 co2 emissions are expected to rise further in as a result of a planned increase in manufacturing activities and production is scheduled to expand by more than 100 over the course of the year we generally expect production to vary from year to year which is why our primary focus will be on reducing our relative environmental and climate impact as early as this year we will be taking a closer look at the relevant key figures to find a way to measure our relative impact since kvistg√•rd accounts for all the company s industrial production and much of its laboratory activities it is also this facility that contributes most to the company 's total carbon footprint the largest sources of emissions at the kvistg√•rd facility are its electrical power consumption and its use of natural gas for heating the power is used to run ventilation systems a refrigeration compressor process equipment refrigerators freezers air compressors office equipment and lighting the natural gas is used for heating and steam production goals we set ourselves a goal for to include more of the company s facilities in our calculation of the group s co2 emissions and we fulfilled this goal by including our mountain view and berlin facilities in calculating our carbon footprint the remaining facilities in washington and singapore are small office facilities that account for less than 2 of the total company headcount their contribution to our carbon emissions total is insignificant and that is why we have decided to omit them from our carbon footprint calculations also in future we have used the data on which our carbon footprint calculations are based to set a starting point for our climate impact which then allows us to set goals to reduce that impact in coming years we will be working with our relative impact based on relevant key figures we will in 2011-2014 endeavour to reduce our relative environmental and climate impact more specifically we will be able to analyse our data in and determine certain relative key figures on this basis a danish household is estimated to produce about 13 tonnes of co2 emissions per year corresponding to 2.1 people with an average emissions level of 6.2 tonnes of co2 annually sources statistics denmark and 'co2 emissions in eco-societies a project report by p√∂yry energy consulting dated july 8 employees employees an organisation in a constant process of development faces certain demands for this reason we put a great deal of effort into forming a shared corporate culture which includes building up systems for the sharing of information and know-how in just a few years bavarian nordic has transformed itself from a purely research- and knowledge-based business into a business that today has its own manufacturing facilities this process brought with it both a major change in staff composition and a significant increase in the number of employees when an organisation is in a constant process of development as we are it faces certain demands for this reason we at bavarian nordic put a great deal of effort into forming a shared corporate culture which includes building up systems for the sharing of information and know-how since we have also maintained a flat management structure over the years the rising number of employees also means that middle managers are responsible for larger groups of staff for this reason we have been focusing on training primarily our mid-level managers to prepare them for the new challenges they face we are an innovative knowledge-based company and it is crucial that we are able to attract and retain highly qualified workers also for this reason we want to offer our staff a good working environment that also provides them with development opportunities there are plentiful opportunities at bavarian nordic both for development within a field of work by rotation between production laboratory and office jobs or for development vertically within the management hierarchy as a result we are happy to recruit internally and we focus on staff development potential in our annual employee performance reviews at bavarian nordic we strive towards a good healthy balance between work and time off work we work actively with stress emphasising awareness of stress indicators on a day-to-day level as well as offering help to handle stress as needed we have been working actively for several years on dialogue-based sickness absence management ahead of legislative trends we generally achieve a quicker return to work by tackling each case individually also including an option to return to work part-time at first all staff at kvistg√•rd are included in our corporate health insurance policy which ensures fast and professional help and treatment at private hospitals and from psychologists chiropractors physiotherapists etc. should the need arise 4 the accident rate is the number of accidents per million working hours 5 this figure was calculated for the entire bavarian nordic group social activities are an important factor in a balanced work life which is why we focus on the social interactivity between employees and employee groups at kvistg√•rd there is an active staff association that regularly implements with the backing of management new initiatives that cater for the various interests employees may have a good safe working environment we must always ensure that company employees can do their jobs under safe and secure conditions and we work continually to optimise work safety the number of work-related accidents was down in from both and levels corresponding to an accident rate of 7.64 for the entire group in versus a rate of 15.2 in 20095 this is a substantially lower rate than the general accident rate among danish firms which was 20.96 in only five work-related accidents were reported in compared with nine in of these five four occurred at kvistg√•rd and one at berlin three of the accidents were among production workers two of which were due to incorrect lifting technique the accident at the berlin facility was a fall in all cases the accidents caused minor injuries that gave rise to less than a week s absence from work the company s occupational health and safety work varies to comply with different countries regulatory requirements at kvistg√•rd workplace assessments are used regularly to chart health and safety factors and relevant improvement initiatives based on these assessments are put forward prioritised and translated into an action plan in compliance with danish regulations a number of health and safety groups and one health and safety committee are appointed that have both management and worker representatives regular committee meetings are held over the course of the year at which members follow up on action plans in order to improve working conditions and safety the focus areas for kvistg√•rd in were regular health and safety inspections uncomfortable work positions in the production group noise mapping plus a possible action plan and reducing work-related falls these initiatives have either been launched or completed it should be noted that the number of 6 confederation of danish industry arbejdsulykker 'work-related accidents from its company statistics falls have dropped to zero at kvistg√•rd which is due to special efforts in this area the fall incidents from were analysed to find the cause of the accidents and this resulted in various preventive measures being taken e.g changing floor cleaning agents the noise problems were solved by moving staff from the noisy rooms and using the rooms as something other than office space workplace assessments will be conducted at kvistg√•rd in and used to find relevant areas for action goals our goal in was to continue to minimise the number of work-related accidents through preventive measures with a special focus on those areas in which most accidents happened the number of work-related accidents was down 44 in compared with the year before a special focus on falling accidents at kvistg√•rd made it possible to cut the number of falls to zero at this facility as described above this was achieved by analysing the reasons behind the various fall incidents and then implementing various measures based on this analysis we believe that the number of work-related accidents has reached a minimum level now and our goal for the future is thus to maintain a correspondingly low level in knowing full well that this will require a special effort the year will see the introduction of a relatively large number of new production staff so we are focused on providing a good training programme for them to minimise the risk of work-related accidents calculated as the total number of sick days divided by the number of fulltime employees 7 8 includes employees at kvistg√•rd martinsried and berlin confederation of danish industry frav√¶rsstatistik 'absence statistics 9 employees 9 absence the total absence at bavarian nordic for was an average of 10 days per employee7 corresponding to an absence rate of 4.6 8 which is on a par with the rate for the average absence measured for the pharmaceutical industry in denmark is 6.6 figures 9 there was a significant drop in number of sick days at our german locations berlin and martinsried which was due to a drop in long-term illness of roughly 27 this drop was however offset by an increase in number of sick days at kvistg√•rd where a greater focus on registering absence has resulted in more valid data absence registration at the various company locations is not yet standardised across the group and in practice such records are actually only kept at our european sites in the united states a 'paid-time-off pto scheme is used which means that employees have the right to take a certain number of days off including sick days without these days being recorded as sick days 10 employees we are continuing to work towards implementing an effective system and preparing uniform guidelines for absence registration at the various group sites that do register it but we are not trying to include all the company locations in this effort as local agreements such as the pto scheme in the usa make this impossible goals in our report we set a goal for the next few years to implement an effective system and draft uniform guidelines for registering absence across the group we began developing this system in kvistg√•rd started a pilot project in its manufacturing section with the implementation of shop floor control an it system that allows absence to be registered directly in our erp system10 we will be running a corresponding pilot project in selected office units in if these pilot projects are successful the plan is first to implement the system for the entire organisation at kvistg√•rd and then look at how the system can be implemented throughout the group also taking into account the specific legislation in effect in the different countries since we are still actively working on the project and since it is a project that will take some time to run we are maintaining our goal from personal and organisational development excellent opportunities for development are not alone vital in ensuring the recruitment and retention of highly qualified employees they are also necessary if employees are to exploit their full potential and thus ensure the competitive ability of the company enterprise resource planning 10 it is crucial that our employees have the necessary tools and techniques to perform well in their jobs now and in future our annual employee performance reviews are thus followed up on and adjusted to meet current and actual needs naturally we comply with the strict requirements with respect to continuing education and skills upgrading that stem from industry regulations national laws and collective agreements but we have no set target number of hours of training per employee our goal is as a minimum for our workers and managers to always have the skills to look for and find their own job goals in our csr report we set ourselves the goal of looking into the possibility of establishing a centralised system for the registration of continuing training activities and qualifications upgrades against this backdrop we are planning the launch of a pilot project in to assess how we can best register and track continuing training and education using our erp system once the options and possibilities with respect to this system have been determined the project will be implemented in a small part of the organisation to start with suppliers 11 suppliers as an integrated element of bavarian nordic s csr policy we wish to lay down a number of guidelines for our collaboration with raw materials suppliers in accordance with good manufacturing practice gmp and our own current supplier management system all raw materials suppliers will have to be audited before final supply contracts can be signed this allows us a unique opportunity to witness and also have an impact on our suppliers involvement in and commitment to socially responsible activities one of our goals in was to set up assessment criteria for our suppliers and we analysed our main supplier data bavarian nordic primarily purchases raw materials from suppliers in north america and the eu and these countries have public regulatory authorities that monitor social and environmental parameters against this backdrop we want to make social responsibility part of the purchasing process by informing potential suppliers about the company s values in our contracts through our csr policies including our environmental health and safety policies new potential suppliers will also be evaluated with respect to their geographical location and thus risk and an assessment will be made as to whether any action is necessary it is our intention to carry out in a more thorough risk assessment of relevant and important suppliers and to evaluate on the basis of fixed criteria whether expanded efforts are needed the above will be implemented in our systems after determining the relevant procedures goals it was our intention in to set a goal for establishing a system for evaluating raw materials suppliers on their social responsibility also taking into account environmental factors work to establish this system began as early as in when we first evaluated the risk of the various facilities relative to their geographical locations and second began implementing our social responsibility values in our contracts work to set up this system will continue in 12 auditor s report auditor s report to the group management of bavarian nordic a/s we have performed a review of

analyzed correlations with the company s activities the review is limited to first of all include inquiries from management and employees as well as analytical procedures and a limited level of assurance is thus lower than the assurance which would have been obtained if we had performed an audit conclusion during our review nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that the data at group level overall are not in accordance with the described reporting principles and practice and information reported from production sites and other business units copenhagen 10th march deloitte statsautoriseret revisionsaktieselskab preben j. s√∏rensen state-authorised public accountant reporting principles and practice 13 reporting principles and practice this csr report was prepared in accordance with danish financial statements act requirements with respect to corporate social responsibility reporting the report was inspired by parts of the global reporting initiative gri a recognised framework for sustainability reports the gri structure includes principles and indicators which we used to measure and explain the company s financial environmental and social performance we do not use the gri as a checklist but as a continued source of inspiration in our reporting our selection of the areas to be reported on was based on a principle of materiality we endeavour to include the most important ways in which the company has an either direct or indirect impact upon the world around it our manufacturing facilities are one of the chief sources of our impact on the environment and by calculating our carbon footprint which is included both in this report and in our annually published green accounts we strive towards a high degree of transparency in reporting our environmental impact our production operations and the activities derived from them e.g quality control laboratories are also the primary source of our raw materials consumption which is why we consider it relevant to include them in this csr report social responsibility aspects are not included in the already extensive audits we conduct today but we will be integrating this into our purchasing process in through our contracts we included more of the company 's sites in our carbon footprint calculation in with respect to absence registration we are currently working on an electronic solution that will in the long term encompass as much of the group as possible however we will not be able to include our mountain view and washington sites as there are certain regulatory aspects which as mentioned above make it impossible to record worker absence data on the whole the most important facilities are included and they account for the great majority of employees and by far the greatest proportion of the total amount of energy consumed by the company http //www.ghgprotocol.org 11 carbon footprint setting a starting point our carbon footprint calculations are based on the standard and recommendations of the greenhouse gas protocol initiative11 for calculating an organisation 's total carbon emissions which include the six greenhouse gasses addressed by the kyoto protocol co2 ch4 n2o hfcs pfcs and sf6 calculated in tonnes of co2 equivalents emissions sources are divided into three scopes direct emissions from activities under the company s control scope 1 emissions from the consumption of electrical power scope 2 and indirect emissions from products and services scope 3 according to the recommendations organisations should report on scope 1 and scope 2 as a minimum and this is what we have decided to do in our carbon footprint statement we calculated the total carbon emissions from our locations at kvistg√•rd martinsried berlin and mountain view with a view to establishing a starting point for four different types of emissions consumption of natural gas and oil this figure is based primarily on current consumption as measured by monthly meter readings oil used for emergency generators however is estimated on the basis of oil consumption over a five-year-period greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels are calculated on the basis of an average emission factor fugitive emissions fugitive emissions include co2 from the use of dry ice and co2 gas plus greenhouse gasses emissions from cooling and refrigeration systems power consumption electrical power consumption is based on meter readings recorded at the end of the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions from electrical power consumption is based on specific emission factors provided by the power company and an average emission factor for the generation of power in germany 14 reporting principles and practice mileage km this figure is calculated on the basis of receipts from petrol companies and includes motor vehicles both owned and leased by the company greenhouse gas emissions are calculated on the basis of an average fuel-specific emission factor for ordinary cars in denmark and germany absence absence data for only cover bavarian nordic staff at our kvistg√•rd martinsried and berlin sites and include registration of staff sick days child sick days hospital visits and admissions and absence as a result of work-related accidents leave also maternity and paternity leave is not included in these figures emission factors for calculating the co2 emission specific emission factors are applied by type of emission and geographic location the co2 emission from combustion of natural gas oil petrol and diesel and fugitive emissions are assessed as having a global effect and only minor local differences the emission factors from these sources are based on data from the danish ministry of climate and energy12 however the emission factor for natural gas from the mountain view facility is based on figures from the pacific gas and electric company13 a supplier of natural gas and electricity in california the absence rate was calculated by taking the average annual number of full-time employees times the number of working days divided by the number of total days of absence emissions for locally-procured electricity have been determined from local factors thus emission factors for kvistg√•rd are based on factors for eastern denmark14 the emission calculations for electricity in mountain view are based on emission factors from the pacific gas and electric company15 the emission calculations for electricity procured in germany are based on general german emisison factors16 whereas the emission calculations for district heating procured in germany are based on emission factors published by the german heat power association agfw e. v.17 '' klimakompasset '' 12 http

bavarian nordic and corporate social responsibility at bavarian nordic we began a targeted effort to systematise our work with corporate social responsibility csr in this is our third csr report we have defined our work with social responsibility on the basis of a number of stakeholder groups and will continue to concentrate on the environment our employees and our suppliers as this is what is most relevant to our business this year we have also expanded the report to include business ethics and have made the description of our products a separate area of focus as a result we now have five focus areas all wholly or partly relat- ed to the three main elements of our csr work people social relationships planet the environment and profit finances as shown in figure 1 the figure also shows how our policies and other specific initiatives cover the three main elements this is explained in greater detail below in section 11 of the report in addition to a general csr policy we have policies within the areas we believe figure 1 bavarian nordic's corporate social responsibility model employees products people health and safety policy code of ethics and business conduct general csr policy business ethics profit planet environmental policy suppliers environment 4 csr report are essential to our work these policies are a natural extension of the various objectives we work towards as a company and their purpose is to create commercial value for the company we do not as yet have an actual suppliers policy but have instead incorporated these elements into our general csr policy we also have a number of other elements to support the company 's csr work a general overview over the most important of these elements appears below at the end of this report in the section entitled 'csr elements reporting principles this csr report was prepared with inspiration from the global reporting initiative gri a recognised framework for sustainability reporting the gri structure includes principles and indicators we use to measure and explain the company s financial environmental and social performance we selected the areas to be reported based on a principle of materiality we endeavoured to include the most important ways in which the company has an either direct or indirect impact upon the world around it our manufacturing facilities are one of the chief sources of our impact on the environment and we seek to provide a high degree of transparency through the carbon footprint we calculate and the environmental data we are reporting for the scope of the report this csr report was prepared in accordance with danish financial statements act requirements with respect to corporate social responsibility reporting the report covers the financial year of 1 january 31 december and forms part of the annual report s management statement as signed and approved by the board of directors and corporate management on 8 march in our csr report we focus on our largest facilities kvistg√•rd headquarters industrial production quality control laboratories technical services department and administration martinsried research and development berlin production of clinical trial materials and mountain view california research and development taken together these facilities employ more than 99 of the group 's staff and are responsible for most by far of the energy and raw materials consumed the other facilities washington dc and singapore are office facilities only and thus of minor importance in this respect since we opened our production facility at kvistg√•rd in 2005 we have published annual 'green accounts reporting on the environmental conditions of the company starting in however we decided to include this information in our csr report instead which has been expanded to include reporting on use of raw and ancillary materials water use wastewater amount and contents waste amounts and air emissions another new feature is reporting on instances of non-compliance with environmental protection law this data is shown below in section 10 thus our csr report includes several more gri indicators than the csr report did see section 12

unmet needs the company 's clinical pipeline focuses on cancer and infectious diseases our two leading projects are prostvac¬Æ a therapeutic prostate cancer vaccine candidate in clinical phase 3 development and imvamune¬Æ a third-generation smallpox vaccine being developed and supplied under contract with the us government the company has built a manufacturing facility at kvistg√•rd in denmark solely for the production and quality control of the smallpox vaccine supplied to the us national strategic stockpile the company is listed on the nasdaq omx copenhagen and has roughly 21 thousand shareholders for more information on the company and its ownership structure please see our annual report or the company 's website www.bavarian-nordic.com 6 csr report 3 policies bavarian nordic develops and manufactures vaccines for the prevention and treatment of life-threatening diseases where there are as yet unmet needs in doing so we seek to create a continuing business that will ensure the company s growth and investment in research and development and thus continue to contribute to a healthier and safer society at the same time we focus on working and acting responsibly with respect to the world we live in we aim to do this by manufacturing high-quality vaccines working actively to minimise our impact on the environment and climate maintaining an active dialogue with our stakeholders on a local national and global level providing a safe and healthy working environment for our staff that includes opportunities for professional and personal development communicating our csr policy to external collaboration partners including our suppliers environmental policy health and safety policy at bavarian nordic we design our vaccine production facilities and procedures so that there is no risk of viruses escaping into the indoor or outdoor environment through the air our waste or our wastewater we at bavarian nordic work continually to improve our environmental efforts a safe and healthy working environment is vital to employee safety and satisfaction at the workplace we always comply with the applicable rules and regulations in this field and focus on systematically mapping both the physical and mental working environment so that the necessary preventive steps can be taken for the benefit of individual employees as well as the company as a whole the aims of our general health and safety policy are our aims are to encourage environmentally aware behaviour and prevent contamination and pollution throughout the company to reduce our environmental impact by developing and using processes that have a minimum of environmental impact optimising our utilisation of materials and energy reducing emissions and waste to comply with environmental protection regulations and relevant requirements to gradually build an environmental management system based on the principles in the iso 14001 standard to promote awareness of healthand safety-related behaviour in all employees as part of their day-today work and to produce proactive solutions to potential problems to gradually develop a management system to facilitate this proactive safety work csr report 7 4 products bavarian nordic helps make the world healthier safer and more secure through its development and production of innovative vaccines for the prevention and treatment of life-threatening diseases through our research we also wish to continue to contribute to human health with the development of new vaccines the company 's most advanced project within infectious diseases is our thirdgeneration smallpox vaccine imvamune¬Æ which is already being produced at our kvistg√•rd facility and supplied to governments around the world to form part of their national preparedness for potential bioterror attacks the vaccine is not yet fully developed but its favourable safety profile and the fact that it has been tested extensively in more than 3,400 people both healthy and immunocompromised has led to certain governments prioritising a stockpile of the vaccine for potential use in persons who do not tolerate the traditional smallpox vaccines the firstand second-generation vaccines used as recently as in the 1970s imvamune¬Æ is manufactured at our kvistg√•rd facility which has been scaled up in recent years to its current capacity of four batches a week due to a large-scale contract with the us government under the current agreement bavarian nordic will provide 20 million doses two million of which were delivered in and four million in deliveries totalling 14 million doses are planned for and the main processes involved in vaccine production are shown below in figure 3 the imvamune¬Æ vaccine is based on a live attenuated virus so it can not be heat sterilised as that would destroy the active substance in the vaccine for this reason a scrupulous quality control and cleanliness assurance has been built into the entire process the pharmaceutical industry works according to the rules of good manufacturing practice or gmp gmp includes strict requirements with respect to a product s traceability strength quality and purity which means that quality management is built into each step of the manufacturing process gmp rules are laid down by the danish european and american health authorities bavarian nordic supplies these markets and thus complies with these quality requirements product safety is crucial in our business and quality and responsibility have been built into our systems and our entire corporate culture figure 3 the imvamune¬Æ smallpox vaccine production process 1 cell production the first part of the process is the production of cells to be used in the subsequent cultivation of the virus cell culture virus replication 2 cell cultivation virus growth the next step is the addition of the virus to the cells the infected cells are allowed to stand for a given amount of time so the virus can replicate harvesting filtering separation virus harvesting the virus is separated from the cells purified and then either stored or packaged formulation filling 8 csr report 5 environment the environment plays an important role at bavarian nordic when we built our factory in the danish town of kvistg√•rd in 2005 we had a great deal of focus on its environmental impact since then we have continually worked to minimise our environmental impact and continue to work actively with environmental health and safety planning in new building projects as well bavarian nordic was categorised as a level 1 company in i.e the environmental protection authorities deem the company to be at the forefront of environmental work within the categories of law-abiding conduct systematisation and information the company intends to remain at this level environmental parameters are regulated by the danish environmental protection authorities through the environmental approval they grant and permission to use the municipal wastewater treatment system we substantially reduced our relative environmental impact in due to a far more efficient utilisation of our production facilities although production has doubled there has been no substantial rise in water and energy consumption above levels in we will be concentrating even more on how we can make our relative environmental impact more efficient with respect to the amount of energy and water we use in addition we will perform an energy screening of our entire kvistg√•rd facility to determine how we can optimise our energy consumption we installed two new steam boilers in to replace the rather old one we had before as the old boiler had overcapacity which resulted in a high level of energy consumption the new solution also gave us a better operational reliability in connection with service and maintenance since there are now two boilers one of the results of this improvement is that energy consumption at the facility has not increased to any significant degree even though production volume is up by about 100 nox and co emissions are also down from previous levels more detailed figures can be found in section 10 below carbon footprint bavarian nordic 's carbon footprint figures can be seen in table 1 of section 10 and in figure 4 below the carbon footprint data shows the company 's energy consumption and emissions expressed in tonnes of co2 total global co2 emissions dropped by 2 from 3,787 tonnes in to 3,700 tonnes in co2 emissions from kvistg√•rd in were largely the same as in although there was a small reduction of less than 1 relative emissions per batch fell to half the level they were year before this is due to the fact that the kvistg√•rd facility doubled the number of batches it produced while total emissions remained almost unchanged the total emissions figure of 3,400 tonnes of co2 corresponds to the emissions produced by about 285 danish households.1 figure 4 carbon footprint global co2 emissions t co2

emissions in eco-societies project report dated july by p√∂yry energy consulting csr report 9 6 employees at bavarian nordic we believe that it pays to have a good working environment both for the company and for its employees a good working environment should ensure satisfied and efficient workers and a low rate of absence due to illness a vital part of a good working environment is a strong sense of identity and shared culture this is especially important when an organisation is growing rapidly for this reason we laid down a set of values in that describe who we are and how we work at bavarian nordic we are currently working actively to implement these values throughout the organisation also by setting up a management development training course for all managers and introducing new employee performance review forms that are based on our values personal and organisational development we are an innovative knowledge-based company and it is important for us to attract and retain highly qualified workers also for this reason we want to offer our staff a good working environment that provides them with development opportunities as well there are plentiful opportunities at bavarian nordic both for development within a field of work by rotation between production laboratory and office jobs or for development vertically within the management hierarchy as a result we are happy to recruit internally and we focus on staff development potential in our annual employee performance reviews it is crucial that our employees have the necessary tools and techniques to perform well in their jobs now and in future our goal is as a minimum for our workers and managers to always have the skills to look for and find their own job for this reason we focus on continuing training and education and on upgrading qualifications also using our employee performance reviews to evaluate needs and wishes in this respect employee health and job satisfaction at bavarian nordic we strive towards a good healthy work-life balance we work actively to counteract stress we have a focus on stress indicators in daily work life and offer help in handling stress as needed our values excellence agility dedication we show ambition and openness to novel approaches we adapt with speed and flexibility to business challenges and opportunities we show commitment and motivation to the development of the business we are goal oriented and deliver on our promises we are accountable and willing to make decisions we show initiative and persistence in what we do we show determination to succeed and perform above expectations and market standards we are enthusiastic in how we work and show a deep felt interest in what we are here for 10 csr report the overall bavarian nordic absence rate for was 3.7 which is lower than the rate for the average absence rate measured for the pharmaceutical industry in denmark as a whole was 5.8 all staff at kvistg√•rd are included in our corporate health insurance policy which ensures fast and professional help and treatment at private hospitals and from psychologists chiropractors physiotherapists etc. should the need arise a good safe working environment we must always ensure that company employees can do their jobs under safe and secure conditions and we work continually to optimise workplace safety the number of work-related accidents that occurred in was lower than in and the accident rate at bavarian nordic is substantially below the average accident rate for white-collar and blue-collar workers at danish business enterprises.2 figure 6 the accident rate at bavarian nordic compared with the di confederation of danish industry statistics for work-related accidents all occupational groups a large number of new employees were hired at kvistg√•rd in so there was a great deal of focus on giving them a careful and complete introduction and start along with sufficient time to learn new work processes and procedures this was one of the factors behind the low accident rate in the company s occupational health and safety work at our different sites varies to comply with different countries regulatory requirements at kvistg√•rd workplace assessments are used regularly to chart health and safety factors and relevant improvement initiatives based on these assessments are put forward prioritised and translated into an action plan in compliance with danish regulations a number of health and safety groups plus one health and safety committee are appointed that have both management and worker representatives regular committee meetings are held over the course of the year at which members follow up on action plans in order to improve working conditions and safety absence the overall bavarian nordic absence rate for was 3.7 which is lower than the rate for the average absence rate measured for the pharmaceutical industry in denmark as a whole was 5.8 .3 the decrease in the absence rate was mainly due to a lower number of employees with a long-term illness we have been working actively for several years on dialogue-based sickness absence management ahead of legislative trends we generally achieve a quicker return to work by handling each case individually also including an option to return to work part-time or with other tasks at first because the company 's absence registration system is not automated it is a timeconsuming task both for the individual employee and for the administrative staff that handle payroll- and personnel-related functions we are still working to implement an efficient and more cost-effective system and to draft uniform guidelines for registering absence across the group employee turnover employee turnover is included in the csr report this year for the

as an integrated element of bavarian nordic s csr policy in we mapped out the geographical locations of our raw materials suppliers and found that they are primarily located in north america and the eu in countries that have public regulatory authorities monitoring social and environmental parameters against this backdrop we decided to implement social and environmental conditions as part of the purchasing process by including in our contracts information on the company 's business ethics and our expectations that our suppliers comply with basic ethical social and environmental guidelines we will also include social and environmental parameters as a regular feature of our supplier auditing procedure in accordance with good manufacturing practice gmp and our own supplier management system currently in place all our raw materials suppliers are subject to audit visits every other year this gives us a unique opportunity to discuss our suppliers own csr work with them starting in we are also reporting on the number of supplier audits we conduct see section 10 below new potential suppliers will also be evaluated with respect to their geographical location and thus the risk they represent and an assessment will be made as to whether any action is necessary in we will begin including csr experience as a point of evaluation in the auditing process we will review the results of these audits over the course of the year and discuss whether any new steps need to be taken we decided to implement social and environmental conditions as part of the purchasing process by including in our contracts information on the company 's business ethics and our expectations that our suppliers comply with basic ethical social and environmental guidelines 12 csr report 8. business ethics bavarian nordic prioritises business ethics as a natural part of its underlying business concept we want to be seen as credible and reliable in the eyes of our collaboration partners and the rest of the world around us bavarian nordic has developed a code of ethics and business conduct that must be observed by everyone in the company management is obliged to take violations of the code seriously the company 's management has also decided to introduce a whistleblower scheme that makes it compulsory to report possible violations this system is intended both to ensure protection of people who report potential violations of the law and to ensure that such reports are investigated and corrective action taken if necessary the preliminary work to establish the programme has begun and implementation is expected sometime in the code of ethics and business conduct contains rules within a large number of areas including compliance with laws rules and regulations conflicts of interest gifts free services and entertainment corrupt practices breach of the code may result in disciplinary action being taken perhaps even termination of employment the code also includes the rules and regulations in the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the truth in negotiations act tina that are relevant in connection with the company 's business transactions and negotiations in the usa the company also otherwise commits itself to cooperating in connection with investigations organised by authorised individuals working on behalf of authorities with legitimate rights csr report 13 9 independent auditor s review report to the executive board of bavarian nordic a/s we have reviewed the key performance indicators on page 14 with supporting tables 1 to 7 for as disclosed in bavarian nordic a/s corporate social responsibility report the report the purpose of our review was to issue a report thereon the data are the responsibility of the company s management our responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our review scope of review we conducted our review in accordance with the danish standard on assurance engagements rs 3000 `` assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information '' the copenhagen 8 march deloitte statsautoriseret revisionspartnerselskab preben j. s√∏rensen state authorised public accountant purpose was to obtain limited assurance that the data presented are in accordance with the reporting practice described in the report on pages 22 and 23 as well as with information submitted by the reporting units our review was based on an assessment of the risk of material misstatement we have evaluated the basis of accounting applied and analysed correlations with the company 's activities the review was limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures and thus a limited level of assurance is lower than the assurance which would have been obtained if we had performed an audit

where the company 's industrial production and a large share of its total laboratory activities take place is also the facility that contributes most to the company 's total carbon footprint the largest source of co2 emissions is the use of electrical power followed by the use of natural gas for heating the power is used to run ventilation systems a refrigeration compressor process equipment refrigerators freezers air compressors office equipment and lighting the natural gas is used for heating and steam production in we laid the groundwork for setting environmental and climate impact targets we have made kvistg√•rd 's carbon footprint a key figure per batch which due to competition reasons is indexed with the year as index 100 in and going forward we will endeavour to continue to reduce our relative climate impact and we will carry out energy screening of the kvistg√•rd facility the emissions factor for natural gas kvistg√•rd has been changed as we have decided to use the danish energy agency as a source going forward we also switched the emission factors for 2009-2010 to danish energy agency figures due to new information the figures for mountain view have been

section 8 of the danish environmental permits act because we built a concrete facing wall without having given the authorities advance notice first the environmental authorities also issued a enforcement notice to secure compliance with a condition in connection with a way to prevent spillover into the storm drain system both matters have been resolved and there are no longer any outstanding issues with the environment authorities we have received no complaints from next-door neighbours or others we are aware of the importance of maintaining a good dialogue with our neighbours when bavarian nordic established a presence in kvistg√•rd we invited our neighbours to an information meeting just as our neighbours and the public in general were involved through two consultation exercises held in connection with the environmental assessment process we have also carried out several projects based on suggestions from our neighbours in our daily work we are occasionally in contact with our neighbours especially in matters to do with noise which is what affects them most directly also because of this contact we are aware of the impact we can have in connection with both our production and our construction projects unit violations of terms etc and accidental discharge number complaints number 2 0 18 csr report 7 employees the number of employees increased in by 14 globally and by 19 at kvistg√•rd the increase is primarily due to new hires at kvistg√•rd resulting from a higher level of activity with production volume having doubled the rate of absence was lower in approximately one third of the employees in kvistg√•rd are under collective agreements with the shortest possible notice at changes of 3x24 hours employee turnover has increased in which partly may be explained by the fact that shiftwork was introduced in the production during the year which may have led to increased number of resignations amongst the employees the accident rate was a little over half what it was the year before in spite of the fact that the level was considered a minimum level and that many new employees were hired in our target for is to maintain the accident rate at or

bavarian nordic develops and manufactures innovative vaccines for the prevention and treatment of life-threatening diseases where there are as yet unmet needs the company 's clinical pipeline focuses on cancer and infectious diseases 1 our two leading projects are prostvac¬Æ a therapeutic prostate cancer vaccine candidate in clinical phase 3 development and imvamune¬Æ a non-replicating smallpox vaccine being developed and supplied under contract with the us government the company is listed on the nasdaq omx copenhagen exchange and has roughly 21 thousand shareholders for more information on the company and its ownership structure please see our annual report or the company 's website www.bavarian-nordic.com the company has built a manufacturing facility at kvistgaard in denmark solely for the production and quality control of the smallpox vaccine supplied to the us national strategic stockpile total emissions from the kvistgaard facility comprising production and associated functions and administration 4 csr-report bavarian nordic and csr in just a few years bavarian nordic has grown from a pure research company into a fully integrated company with an in-house production of vaccines this transformation combined with a high rate of organic growth has required a great deal of systematic and thorough work adapting the organization to its new tasks as a production company while also taking the world around us into account in order ensure to that our operations are responsible from both a financial and a social perspective in extension of our annual environmental report which we began publishing in 2005 when we started up production at our production facility we began working systematically with several aspects of csr 2 in initially concentrating on our key stakeholders our employees and suppliers the environment our employees and our suppliers continue to constitute the core of our csr activities but we also include other areas of significance to our business in our report we have defined an additional two areas of focus business ethics and products as a result we now have five focus areas all wholly or partly related to the three main elements of our csr work people social relationships planet the environment and profit finances as shown in the figure below the figure below also shows how our policies and other specific initiatives cover the three main elements this is explained in greater detail in the section csr elements of the report bavarian nordic 's csr model employees products people health and safety policy code of ethics and business conduct general csr policy business ethics profit planet environmental policy suppliers 2 csr corporate social responsibitlity environment in addition to a general csr policy we have policies within the areas we believe are essential to our work these policies are a natural extension of the various objectives we work towards as a company and their purpose is to create commercial value for the company we do not as yet have an actual suppliers policy but we have instead incorporated these elements into our general csr policy we also have a number of other elements to support the company 's csr work a general overview over the most important of these elements appears below at the end of this report in the section csr elements about the report this csr report was prepared in accordance with danish financial statements act requirements with respect to csr reporting the report covers the financial year 1 january to 31 december and forms part of the management 's review in the annual report as signed and approved by the board of directors and corporate management on 12 march reporting principles this csr report was prepared with inspiration from the global reporting initiative gri a recognized framework for sustainability reporting the gri structure includes principles and indicators we use to measure and explain the company s financial environmental and social performance we selected the areas to be reported on based on a principle of materiality we endeavored to include the most important ways in which the company has an either direct or indirect impact upon the world around it our manufacturing facilities are one of the chief sources of our impact on the environment and we seek to provide a high degree of transparency through our carbon footprint and reported environmental data the scope of the report in our csr report we focus on our largest facilities i.e kvistgaard industrial production quality control laboratories technical services department and administration martinsried research and development berlin production of clinical trial materials and mountain view california re- csr-report 5 search and development taken together these facilities employ more than 99 of the group 's staff and are responsible for most by far of the energy and raw materials consumed the other facilities in washington dc and singapore are office facilities only and thus of minor importance in this respect as part of the optimization of our production competencies we are closing our berlin facility in and transferring its activities to kvistgaard so data for berlin will not be included in the report going forward the scope of this report has not been expanded from the report in which we included additional data on our employees and considerably more environmental data that was previously included in our green accounts this year the report includes more comparative figures from when we started our csr activities and to date in order to give a more complete true and fair view of how we have changed and developed in recent years 6 csr-report policies bavarian nordic develops and manufactures vaccines for the prevention and treatment of life-threatening diseases where there are as yet unmet needs in doing so we seek to create a continuing business that will ensure the company s growth and investment in research and development and thus continue to contribute to a healthier and safer society at the same time we focus on working and acting responsibly with respect to the world we live in we aim to do this by environmental and climate policy at bavarian nordic we design our vaccine production facilities and procedures so that there is no risk of viruses escaping into the indoor or outdoor environment through the air our waste or our wastewater we at bavarian nordic work continually to improve our environmental and climate performance our aims are to encourage environmentally aware behavior and prevent contamination and pollution throughout the company to reduce our environmental and climate impact by developing and using processes that have a minimum of environmental impact health and safety policy a safe and healthy working environment is vital to employee safety and satisfaction at the workplace we always comply with applicable rules and regulations in this field and focus on systematically mapping both the physical and mental working environment so that the necessary preventive steps can be taken for the benefit of individual employees as well as the company as a whole the aims of our general health and safety policy are to promote awareness of health- and safety-related behavior in all employees as part of their day-to-day work and to produce proactive solutions to potential problems manufacturing high-quality vaccines working actively to minimize our impact on the environment and climate optimizing our utilization of materials and energy reducing emissions and waste maintaining an active dialog with our stakeholders on a local national and global level actively supporting and respecting human rights and labor standards providing a safe and healthy working environment for our staff that includes opportunities for professional and personal development communicating our csr policy to external collaboration partners including our suppliers to comply with environmental protection regulations and relevant requirements to gradually build an environmental management system based on the principles in the iso 14001 standard to gradually develop a management system to facilitate this proactive safety work csr-report 7 products bavarian nordic helps make the world healthier safer and more secure through our development and production of innovative vaccines for the prevention and treatment of life-threatening diseases research into and development of new vaccines requires substantial investment so before we can do this we must have a lasting and profitable business through contracts with the us government we have successfully developed a new smallpox vaccine that we manufacture and supply to the us national strategic stockpile and this has laid the necessary foundation for the further development of our business and of new products to benefit patients in the future built into our systems and our entire corporate culture imvamune¬Æ smallpox vaccine our most advanced infectious disease project is the imvamune¬Æ smallpox vaccine which is already being manufactured at our kvistgaard facility the vaccine is not yet fully developed but its favorable safety profile has led to certain governments prioritizing a stockpile of the vaccine for potential use in persons who do not tolerate the traditional smallpox vaccines well our primary customer is the us government which ordered 20 million doses in for delivery in 2010-2013 afterwards we expect to receive new orders regularly from the us government prostvac¬Æ belongs to a new class of treatment immunotherapy where the idea is to train the patient 's own immune system to fight cancer the treatment is administered as a vaccine seven injections over five months and is not associated with the serious side effects otherwise seen with conventional cancer therapy in an earlier large-scale phase 2 clinical study the vaccine demonstrated an increased median survival of 8.5 months for patients with advanced prostate cancer these results are among the best ever demonstrated in this patient group and they have led to the start-up of a phase 3 clinical study the imvamune¬Æ vaccine is based on a live attenuated virus so it can not be heat sterilized as that would destroy the active ingredient of the vaccine for this reason a scrupulous quality control and cleanliness assurance has been built into the entire process the pharmaceutical industry works according to gmp gmp includes strict requirements with respect to a product s traceability strength quality and purity which means that quality management is built into each step of the manufacturing process gmp 3 rules are laid down by the danish european and american health authorities bavarian nordic supplies these markets and thus complies with these quality requirements product safety is crucial in our business and quality and responsibility have been 3 good manufacturing practice prostvac¬Æ prostate cancer immunotherapy our leading project in cancer is prostvac¬Æ which is in final phase 3 development the phase 3 clinical study will be conducted globally and include a total of 1,200 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer we intend to apply for a marketing authorization for prostvac¬Æ once positive data from the study are available we have already begun preliminary activities with a view to market launch including preparations for manufacturing the vaccine at our kvistgaard facility an approved vaccine for treating prostate cancer is expected to considerably improve therapeutic options for patients with late-stage prostate cancer 8 csr-report environment and climate most of bavarian nordic's impact on the environment and climate comes from our production so we pay particular attention to improving efficiency and our manufacturing processes in order to optimize our use of natural resources when we built our factory in the danish town of kvistgaard in 2005 we had a great deal of focus on the factory's environmental impact since then we have continually worked to minimize our environmental impact and we continue to work actively with environmental health and safety planning in new building projects as well in connection with recent years expansion of the facility and its production we have also paid particular attention to our impact on the community and make an effort to remain in communication with our neighbors especially with respect to noise which is what affects them most directly in we exceeded the noise limits on a single reference point in connection with the installation of new cooling containers however we received no complaints from our neighbors or others so as permitted by danish law we have applied for these restrictions to be eased a wastewater test measurement in december showed that it exceeded permitted ph and chloride content levels an investigation has been initiated to identify the cause of this the environmental protection authorities have categorized bavarian nordic as a level 1 company i.e they deem the company to be at the forefront of environmental work within the categories of law-abiding conduct systematization and information bavarian nordic was categorized at this level in and most recently again in following an environmental inspection the company intends to remain at this level in we further reduced our relative climate impact due to a far more efficient utilization of our production facilities although production has doubled there has been no substantial increase in our use of water and energy we will continue to focus on opportunities to reduce our relative climate impact in late we installed a new energy monitoring system at our facility at kvistgaard to collect data and track our use of energy and water the new system allows us to identify inappropriate consumption and thus make improvements moreover we will be conducting an energy screening of our entire kvistgaard facility to find out how and where we can optimize our energy consumption we expect to select an external service provider to conduct the screening in the first half of csr-report 9 employees bavarian nordic has in recent years moved from being a purely research-based business to also encompassing in-house production and quality control these are areas in which many different staff groups work together and the rapid growth we have seen has made it essential for us to establish a shared identity and culture for the company and its employees after a process involving employees from all levels and areas of the organization we defined a set of corporate values in that describe who we are and how we work at bavarian nordic in we worked actively to implement these values throughout the organization some of the work was at a general level communicating the values and making them visible in the organization and some was more concrete with employees working to implement the values at the local and department level these values have also become an integral part of the annual employee performance interviews and we have started up a management development course also based on the values we also established an hr forum in with representatives from the hr functions of both of our divisions its purpose is to ensure overall coordination of management initiatives and to establish a best practice for the area personal and organizational development we are an innovative knowledge-based company and it is important for us to attract and retain highly qualified workers also for this reason we want to offer our staff a good working environment that provides them with development opportunities as well there are good opportunities at bavarian nordic both for development within a field of work by rotation between production laboratory and office jobs or for development vertically within the management hierarchy as a result we are happy to recruit internally and we focus on staff development potential in our annual employee performance reviews it is crucial that our employees have the necessary tools and techniques to perform well in their jobs now and in future our goal is as a minimum for our workers and managers to always have the skills to look for and find their own job for this reason we focus on continuing training and education and on upgrading qualifications also those of the many employees who work in the gmp areas furthermore we allocated additional funds for training in and more employees took external courses a few have begun taking classes in training or educational programs while continuing to work at bavarian nordic in we also began offering a management development course for all employees with management responsibility employee health and job satisfaction at bavarian nordic we strive towards a good healthy work-life balance and at work we focus on employee health and job satisfaction all staff at kvistgaard are included in our corporate health insurance plan which ensures fast and professional help and treatment at private hospitals and from psychologists chiropractors physical therapists etc. should the need arise our values excellence agility dedication we show ambition and openness to novel approaches we adapt with speed and flexibility to business challenges and opportunities we show commitment and motivation to the development of the business we are goal oriented and deliver on our promises we are accountable and willing to make decisions we show initiative and persistence in what we do we show determination to succeed and perform above expectations and market standards we are enthusiastic in how we work and show a deep felt interest in what we are here for 10 csr-report we work actively to counteract stress we have a focus on stress indicators in daily work life and offer help in handling stress as needed in we established a work group which is to prepare a catalogue of suggestions for improving employee well-being at work and job satisfaction we have taken up some of the suggestions and begun implementing all or parts of them the work group is a supplement to procedures already established in the organization such as works council meetings at which both labor and management are represented and regularly discuss issues that can have an impact on employee job satisfaction and employment conditions a good safe working environment the company s occupational health and safety work at our different sites varies to comply with different countries regulatory requirements at kvistgaard workplace assessments are used regularly to chart health and safety factors and relevant improvement initiatives based on these assessments are put forward prioritized and translated into an action plan in compliance with danish regulations a number of health and safety groups plus one health and safety committee have been appointed that have both management and worker representatives regular committee meetings are held over the course of the year at which members follow up on action plans in order to improve working conditions and safety although there was a marginal increase in the accident rate in the rate has been falling in recent years and is still considerably lower than the average accident rate at danish companies not a single work-related accident was reported at kvistgaard in and that is where most of the company 's employees work in order to counter the risk of ac- cidents we have in recent years focused especially on the induction and training of new staff especially in production facilities and laboratories with many new employees this has helped reduce the number of accidents absence we have been working actively for several years on dialog-based sickness absence management ahead of legislative trends we generally achieve a quicker return to work by handling each case individually also including an option to return to work part-time or be assigned other tasks at first after pilot testing in the spring of we introduced electronic systems for tracking absence at our kvistgaard facility in the second half of our absence tracking system was not automated before so it was a time-consuming task both for employees and the administrative staff handling payroll- and personnelrelated functions with the new systems in place we expect to reduce administrative work in tracking and following up on absence while also achieving greater accuracy of records our culture at bavarian nordic we offer a challenging international working environment in which job satisfaction and personal development have a high priority we are committed to making it a great place to work by empowering our employees to perform their tasks to their own satisfaction while aiming for the success of the company we encourage innovative thinking that promotes beneficial change for both the individual and the company we believe that flexibility and a willingness to adapt are key characteristics for success as a company and as employees we respect different personalities and cultures and believe that the diversity of our employees creates value for the company we strive for an integrated business culture driven by teamwork and mutual respect while at the same time recognizing the individual effort we expect our employees to be accountable in all aspects of their working life work-related accidents sickness absence frequence absence rates 30 6 25 5 20 4 15 3 10 2 5 1 0 0 bavarian nordic all companies number

compared with di confederation of danish industry statistics for sickness absence all companies csr-report 11 suppliers as an integral part of bavarian nordic 's csr policy we wish to maintain an active dialog with our suppliers about social responsibility and environmental initiatives in we mapped out the geographical locations of our raw materials suppliers and found that they are mainly located in north america and the eu in countries that already have a high level of regulation of social and environmental parameters new potential suppliers will also be evaluated with respect to their geographical location and thus the risk they represent and an assessment will be made as to whether any action is necessary a large number of our suppliers communicate openly and honestly about their csr work just as we in our interaction with them inform them of our csr policies and activities more specifically we decided to implement social and environmental conditions as part of the purchasing process in by including in our contracts information on the company 's business ethics and our expectations that our suppliers comply with basic ethical social and environmental guidelines a potential effect of this new initiative is yet to be recorded however the company hopes that it will contribute to an increased positive dialogue with its suppliers as well as transparency on social and environmental issues in accordance with good manufacturing practice gmp and our own supplier management system currently in place all our new raw materials suppliers are subject to audit following the initial audit suppliers are evaluated every third year as a minimum either by way of a visit or a questionnaire depending on the situation the audits do not include csr-related issues but they provide a very good opportunity to talk with the suppliers about their attitudes and practices in the area and also to comment on any problematic issues in we performed 22 audits and none of them caused us to comment on or point to any such issues we have implemented social and environmental conditions as part of the purchasing process by including in our contracts information on the company 's business ethics and our expectations that our suppliers comply with basic ethical social and environmental guidelines 12 csr-report business ethics bavarian nordic prioritizes business ethics as a natural part of its underlying business concept we want to be seen as credible and reliable in the eyes of our collaboration partners and the rest of the world around us we have developed a code of ethics and business conduct that must be observed by everyone in the company management is obliged to take violations of the code seriously the code of ethics and business conduct contains rules within a large number of areas including compliance with laws and regulations conflicts of interest gifts free services and entertainment corrupt practices the code also includes the rules and regulations in the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the truth in negotiations act tina that are relevant in connection with the company 's business transactions and negotiations in the usa the company otherwise commits itself to cooperating in connection with investiga- tions organized by authorized individuals working on behalf of authorities with legitimate rights ethical hotline to be introduced in management has decided to introduce an ethical hotline to give employees the opportunity to report possible violations of the code a special work group under management worked in to investigate the practical aspects of setting up such a hotline which will be established in collaboration with a third-party service provider partly to protect the employees who raise concerns and partly to ensure that the necessary investigations are conducted when a concern has been raised and that corrective action is taken if necessary as the ethical hotline may involve reporting of personally sensitive data it must be pre-approved by the danish data protection agency we have filed an application with the agency and expect to put the ethical hotline into operation sometime in the first half of csr-report 13 independent auditor s report on key performance indicators to the executive board of bavarian nordic a/s we have reviewed the key performance indicators for in table 1 to 7 as disclosed in bavarian nordic a/s csr report for the purpose of issuing an auditor s report in this respect danish audit regulation to obtain limited assurance about our conclusion we have obtained limited assurance because compared to a reasonable assurance engagement our work has been limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures the company s management is responsible for the csr report our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the review of the key performance indicators in the csr report based on our review the purpose has been to obtain limited assurance that the data presented in the csr report are in accordance with the reporting practice described and the information reported by the reporting units included scope of work we

5 global 1 carbon footprint our total co2 emissions were down by 4 in spite of increased production at kvistgaard and increased activities in our cancer vaccine division in connection with the start-up of the prostvac¬Æ phase 3 study which included among other things an expansion of our mountain view facility and an increase in headcount at kvistgaard co2 emissions were down by almost 10 year on year in spite of a substantial increase in the number of vaccine doses produced total production output has almost doubled as a result of a continuing focus on process efficiencies and utilization of resources combined with a reduction in energy consumption this led to an improvement in relative emissions per dose produced which were down by 27 on and 65 on kvistgaard where our industrial production and a large share of our laboratory activities take place is also the facility that contributes most to our total carbon footprint the largest source of co2 emissions is the use of electrical power followed by the use of natural gas for heating the power is used to run ventilation systems a refrigeration compressor process equipment refrigerators freezers air compressors office equipment and lighting the natural gas is used for heating and steam production table 1 unit carbon footprint global t co2 direct emissions scope 1 heating t co2 power generation t co2 fugitive

which has led to hirings in the cancer division primarily in the r d department at mountain view there was a minor reduction in production staff at kvistgaard in as a result of resource and process optimization over a longer period of time which has helped increase profitability as part of this optimization process the kvistgaard facility will take over the activities previously handled in berlin and the berlin facility will be closed sometime in which will result in a minor headcount reduction the absence rate rose in but was below and levels the absence rate includes employees at kvistgaard martinsried and berlin the absence rate for kvistgaard was 3.5 while the combined rate for martinsried and berlin was 5.7 about 80 of the absence at martinsried and berlin was due to long-term sick leaves the rate of employee turnover dropped marginally in in spite of the production staff cuts resulting from the production improvements implemented over the year in there were only four minor work-related accidents involving sickness absence more than one day so our accident rate remains low in the four years reported our accident rate has been substantially below the rate of

activities under the company s control scope 1 emissions from the consumption of electrical power scope 2 and indirect emissions from products and services scope 3 according to the recommendations organizations should report on scope 1 and scope 2 as a minimum and this is what we have decided to do in our carbon footprint statement carbon footprint we calculated the total carbon emissions from our locations at kvistgaard martinsried berlin and mountain view with a view to establishing a starting point for the following four different types of emissions our carbon footprint calculations are based on the standard and recommendations of the greenhouse gas protocol initiative 7 for calculating an organization s total carbon emissions which include the six greenhouse gasses addressed by the kyoto protocol co2 ch4 n2o hfcs pfcs and sf6 calculated in metric tons of co2 7 www.ghgprotocol.org natural gas and oil this figure is based primarily on current consumption as measured by monthly meter readings oil used for emergency generators however is estimated on the basis of oil consumption over a five-year period greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels are calculated on the basis of an average emission factor fugitive emissions fugitive emissions include co2 from the use of dry ice and co2 gas plus emissions of greenhouse gasses from cooling and refrigeration systems electricity electrical power consumption is based on meter readings recorded at the end of the year the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions from electrical power consumption is based on specific emission factors provided by the power company and an csr-report 23 average emission factor for the generation of power in germany mileage km this figure is calculated on the basis of receipts from petrol companies and includes motor vehicles owned or leased by the company greenhouse gas emissions are calculated on the basis of an average fuel-specific emission factor for ordinary cars in denmark and germany emission factors in calculating co2 emissions specific emission factors based on emission type and geographic location were used co2 emissions from the combustion of natural gas oil petrol diesel fuel and lpg and from fugitive emissions were deemed to have a general global effect with minor local differences emission factors from these sources are based on data provided by the danish energy agency 8 except for natural gas emission factors for mountain view which are based on figures from the pacific gas and electric company 9 a provider of natural gas and electricity in california emissions for locally purchased electricity were determined on the basis of local conditions emission factors for kvistgaard are based on factors for denmark as a whole 10 emission calculations for electrical power at mountain view are based on emission factors provided by the pacific gas and electric company emission calculations for electrical power purchased in germany are based on general german emission factors 11 emission calculations for district heating purchased in germany are based on emission factors published by the german confederation of energy efficiency improvement within heating cooling and combined heat and power generation 12 indexed co2 emissions per dose produced co2 emissions per dose produced are indexed to and calculated on the basis of the number of batches initiated and the average yield number of doses per batch employees absence absence data includes registration of staff sick days and child sick days leave also maternity and paternity leave is not included in these figures the absence rate was calculated by dividing the number of days of absence by the average number of full-time employees for the year times the number of work days in the calendar year employee turnover staff turnover is calculated as the number of employees that left their jobs divided by the average number of employees over the course of the year accidents work-related accident data relates to accidents resulting in more than one day of absence the definition of 'work-related accident in danish law is the definition applicable in this document the accident rate is calculated using the total annual number of working hours in the group based on the average annual number of full-time employees times the number of annual working hours holidays are not included raw and ancillary materials raw materials for production are calculated based on the company 's inventory system erp system and figures refer to consumption for the

brief bavarian nordic is a global company that develops and manufactures innovative vaccines and immunotherapies for the prevention and treatment of life-threatening diseases where there are as yet unmet needs the company 's clinical pipeline focuses on cancer and infectious diseases the company received its first product approval in with the marketing authorization of the imvanex¬Æ smallpox vaccine in the european union in august the vaccine was later approved in canada in november under the name of imvamune¬Æ the vaccine was developed over a number of years in a collaboration with the u.s. government and the company has since supplied more than 20 million doses of the vaccine to the u.s. strategic national stockpile the company 's other leading program is prostvac¬Æ an immunotherapy candidate for the treatment of prostate cancer which is in phase 3 clinical development the company has research laboratories in mountain view california and martinsried germany the company 's head office and production facilities are located in kvistgaard denmark listed on the nasdaq omx copenhagen exchange the company has roughly 21 thousand shareholders for more information on the company and its ownership structure please see our annual report or the company's website www.bavarian-nordic.com csr report 4 introduction the year was an eventful one for bavarian nordic with our first product approval from both the european and canadian drug authorities we received a seal of approval of our vaccine technology which we have developed over the past ten-plus years this has created a solid platform for further development of new vaccines a development that is primarily driven by contracts with the u.s. government which sees additional potential in our technology for use against potential bioterror threats the most important thing that happened in was however winning a new supply contract from the u.s. government for the continued supply of imvamune¬Æ smallpox vaccine to the u.s. strategic national stockpile as part of our growth strategy we continue to invest solidly in the development of new cancer immunotherapies for which the pivotal product is prostvac¬Æ our product candidate for treating prostate cancer in the large-scale global phase 3 study of prostvac also reached denmark where patients are now receiving treatment under the study a total of 1,200 patients in 15 countries are expected to be enrolled in the study which would form the basis for a subsequent approval of prostvac provided the results are successful as part of the preparations for launching prostvac also saw us beginning to expand our production facilities at kvistgaard in denmark in order to have the capacity to manufacture several different products there we successfully continued to reduce our aggregate climate impact reducing our co2 emissions by almost 9 in after a time spent upscaling our production production volumes were slightly lower in than in previous years combined with significant improvements in our production process we managed to further reduce our consumption of energy and raw materials we are focused on health and employee well-being and were pleased to record a drop in sickness absence among our employees in although the rate remained higher than the average for danish companies this can mainly be explained by the special requirements for our production including production staff not being allowed to return to work until they have completely recovered from an illness another aspect of our efforts to ensure that we have a healthy and safe work- place is the comprehensive occupational environment work we do in our organisation which includes user involvement at all levels and in compliance with national legislation for this reason we were not satisfied to note that the number of reported occupational accidents increased in however most of them were minor accidents a fact that is reflected in the minimal number of related sick days the accidents were not related to our working processes but were random and thus could not have been avoided through our preventive work however our goal is to continue to reduce the general accident risk paying special attention to any nearaccidents in our csr work will continue to focus primarily on environment and staff but we will also remain attentive to the ever-growing wishes demands and requirements from the world around us including any new legislation this is something also reflected in the new goals we have set for our csr work in and the years ahead which are

improve the conditions that can generate better business value for the company as part of our overall goal of creating the greatest possible shareholder value for example we will constantly work to optimize our production processes also by reducing our consumption of raw materials and energy just as we also naturally continue to strive towards a well-functioning workplace with informed satisfied and healthy employees and the resultant lower levels of sickness absence and occupational accidents these and other general goals are fully integrated into the operation of our business and form part of the ongoing evaluations in the respective areas in addition we have set the following specific objectives for our csr work for the coming years area objective timing environment we will establish kpis for our consumption of energy and chemicals and for production waste working environment we will work to reduce the number of occupational accidents to an annual number equivalent or less than the average of the past three years working environment we will work to keep overall sickness absence below 4 in addition we will endeavor to set individual targets for sickness absence for white-collar and blue-collar workers and to report performance in this respect going forward business ethics we will establish a training program for ethical conduct/anti-corruption employees we will work over the next three years to reduce rates of employee turnover to a level below the average of the previous three years human rights we will conduct a screening of the un guiding principles on human rights and business human rights we will work to maintain an equal gender distribution among the managers of the group csr report 6 bavarian nordic and csr in just a few years bavarian nordic has grown from a pure research company into a fully integrated company with activities ranging from early research to the in-house production of vaccines this transformation combined with a high rate of organic growth has required a great deal of systematic and thorough work to adapt the organization to its new tasks as a production company while also considering the world around us in order to ensure that our operations are responsible from both a financial and a social point of view in addition to our annual environmental reporting we began working systematically with other aspects of csr in this work is concentrated on the environment our employees and our suppliers but we also include other areas of significance to our business and have defined an additional two areas of focus business ethics and products as a result we now have five focus areas all wholly or partly related to the three main elements of our csr work people social relationships planet the environment and profit finances as shown in the figure below the figure below also shows how our policies and other specific initiatives cover the three main elements bavarian nordic 's csr model employees products

the company's general strategy of creating a profitable business many of the specific targets stated in this report are derived directly from activities that support our general strategic goals we are constantly working to identify areas that are crucial to the company 's business and also have or could have a positive impact on performance in working towards to the csr targets set the model is explained in greater detail in the section of this report entitled `` csr elements '' in addition to a general csr policy we have policies in the areas we believe are essential to our work these policies are a natural extension of the various objectives we work towards as a company whose purpose is to create commercial value for the company we do not as yet have an actual suppliers policy but have instead incorporated these elements into our general csr policy neither do we have a policy for human rights but we are aware of the un guiding principles on business and human rights which we will investigate further in relation to our business we also have a number of other elements to support the company 's csr work a general overview of the most important of these elements appears at the end of this report in the section `` csr elements '' about the report this csr report was prepared in accordance with the danish financial statements act requirements with respect to csr reporting the report covers the financial year january 1 to december 31 and forms part of the management 's review in the annual report as signed and approved by the board of directors and corporate management on march 19 reporting principles this csr report was prepared with inspiration from the global reporting initiative gri a recognized framework for sustainability reporting the gri structure includes principles and indicators we use to measure and explain the company s financial environmental and social performance we selected the areas to be reported on based on a principle of materiality we endeavored to include the most important ways in which the company has either a direct or an indirect impact on the world around it our production facilities are one of the chief sources of our impact on the environment and we seek to provide a high degree of transparency by calculating our carbon footprint and reporting environmental data scope of the report in our csr report we focus on our largest facilities i.e kvistgaard industrial production quality control laboratories technical services department and administration martinsried research and development berlin production of clinical trial materials and mountain view california research and development taken together these facilities employ more than 99 of the group 's staff and are responsible for the greatest share by far of the energy and raw materials consumed by the group as part of our efforts to optimize our production competencies we closed our berlin facility in and transferred its operations to kvistgaard as a certain level of activity was maintained at the berlin facility in the first six months of we have elected to include the data from berlin in this report the scope of this report has not been expanded compared with our report csr report 8 policies bavarian nordic develops and manufactures vaccines for the prevention and treatment of life-threatening diseases where there are as yet unmet needs in doing so we seek to create a continuing business that will ensure the company s growth and investment in research and development and thus continue to contribute to a healthier and safer society at the same time we focus on working and acting responsibly with respect to the world we live in we aim to do this by manufacturing high-quality vaccines working actively and systematically to minimize our impact on the environment and climate that viruses do not escape into the indoor or outdoor environment through the air in our waste or in our wastewater at bavarian nordic we continually work to improve our environmental and climate performance our aims are to encourage environmentally aware behavior and prevent contamination and pollution throughout the company maintaining an active dialog with our stakeholders on a local national and global level to reduce our environmental and climate impact impact by actively supporting and respecting human rights and labor standards developing and using processes with a minimum of environmental impact providing a safe and healthy working environment for our staff that includes opportunities for professional and personal development optimizing our utilization of materials and energy communicating our csr policy to external collaboration partners including our suppliers to comply with environmental protection regulations and relevant requirements environmental and climate policy at bavarian nordic we design our vaccine production facilities and procedures so to gradually build an environmental management system based on the principles in the iso 14001 standard reducing emissions and waste health and safety policy a safe and healthy working environment is vital to employee safety and satisfaction at the workplace we focus on systematically mapping both the physical and mental working environment so that the necessary preventive steps can be taken for the benefit of both individual employees and the company as a whole the aims of our general health and safety policy are to promote awareness of health- and safety-related behavior in all employees as part of their day-to-day work and to produce proactive solutions to potential problems to gradually develop an environmental health and safety management system to support this proactive safety work csr report 9 products bavarian nordic helps make the world healthier safer and more secure through our development and production of innovative vaccines and immunotherapies for the prevention and treatment of life-threatening diseases research into and development of new products requires substantial investment so a precondition for this work is the ability to create a lasting and profitable business through contracts with the u.s. government we have successfully developed a new smallpox vaccine that we manufacture for the u.s. strategic national stockpile and this has laid the necessary foundation for the further development of our business and new products to benefit patients in the future product safety is crucial in our business and quality and responsibility are important elements of our corporate culture drug development is already one of the most regulated areas in which a strong regulatory regime of inspections and approvals sets a high standard for all areas of our disciplines imvanex¬Æ smallpox vaccine our imvanex smallpox vaccine was approved in the european union in august and in canada in november under the name of imvamune we have manufactured the vaccine at our kvistgaard facility for a number of years and supplied it to various governments although we only obtained marketing 1 good manufacturing practice authorizations for the vaccine in certain countries have prioritised having a stockpile of the vaccine for potential use as part of their biological preparedness in persons who do not tolerate the traditional smallpox vaccines well our primary customer is the u.s. government which ordered 20 million doses in for delivery in 2010-2013 the u.s. government placed a new order in april which runs into the imvanex vaccine is based on a live attenuated virus so it can not be heat sterilized because that would destroy the active ingredient in the vaccine for this reason a scrupulous quality control and hygiene assurance has been built into the entire process the pharmaceutical industry works according to gmp2 gmp includes strict requirements with respect to a product s traceability strength quality and purity which means that quality management is built into each step of the manufacturing process gmp rules are laid down by the danish european and u.s. health authorities bavarian nordic supplies these markets and thus complies with these quality requirements prostvac¬Æ prostate cancer immunotherapy prostvac is our leading cancer project in final phase 3 development prostvac belongs to a new class of treatment immunotherapy aimed at training the patient 's own immune system to fight cancer in an earlier large-scale phase 2 clinical study the vaccine demonstrated an increased median survival time of 8.5 months for patients with advanced prostate cancer these results are among the best ever demonstrated in this patient group and they have led to the start-up of a global phase 3 clinical study in 1200 patients with metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer we intend to apply for a marketing authorization for prostvac once positive data from the study are available we have already begun preliminary activities with a view to a market launch including preparations for manufacturing the vaccine at our kvistgaard facility where the construction of a new production unit began in after we received environmental approval in june csr report 10 environment and climate most of bavarian nordic 's impact on the environment and climate comes from our production so we pay particular attention to improving efficiency and our manufacturing processes in order to optimize our use of resources when we built our factory in the danish town of kvistgaard in 2005 we had a great deal of focus on the factory's environmental impact since then we have continually worked to minimize our environmental impact and we continue to work actively with environmental health and safety planning in new building projects as well also in connection with the construction of the new building in which prostvac will be manufactured the new features of the building will include recirculation of air to save on energy consumption as approved by the danish working environment authority in connection with recent years expansion of the facility and its production we have also paid particular attention to our impact on the community making an effort to remain in communication with our neighbors especially with respect to noise which is what may affect them most directly in we exceeded the noise limits on a single reference point in connection with the installation of new cooling containers however we received no complaints from our neighbors or others so we applied for these restrictions to be eased pursuant to danish law in in march the danish environmental protection agency turned down our application for the noise limits to be eased so we have begun installing a noise screen to limit the noise we subsequently made a new measurement of noise throughout the facility which was documented in a report issued in november the report contains an updated calculation of noise conditions around the facility the noise exposure has been determined at all reference points and shows that the noise exposure is lower than the noise limits set during all day and night periods a wastewater test measurement in december showed that it exceeded permitted ph and chloride content levels an investigation was launched and a slightly elevated content of chloride was found probably due to road salt no cause of the elevated ph level was identified a test measurement in october showed that all parameters were in compliance the environmental protection authorities have categorized bavarian nordic as a level 1 company i.e they deem the company to be at the forefront of environmental work this is reflected in a high degree of compliance and systematization the environmental authorities no longer categorize companies but it is bavarian nordic 's goal to remain at a high level in its environmental work also as we await a new initiative from the environmental authorities in the course of in we maintained our low level of relative climate impact which was achieved as we continued to work towards a more efficient utilization of our production facilities we will continue to focus on opportunities to reduce our relative climate impact in late we installed a new energy monitoring system at our kvistgaard facility to collect data and track our use of energy and water the new system allows us to identify inappropriate consumption and thus make improvements in we had the opportunity to analyse our consumption figures and we will continue to do so in in order to define future reduction targets moreover we will be conducting an energy screening of our entire kvistgaard facility in to find out how and where we can optimize our energy consumption we will conduct the energy screening when we have selected an external service provider to so bavarian nordic 's environmental permit from september 7 2004 is up for reassessment so we prepared a new updated environmental technical description in late against this backdrop the environmental authorities will conduct a reassessment also looking at the limits set sometime in the purpose of the update is to incorporate the changes that have occurred since 2004 including an environmental approval of the manufacture of prostvac from june csr report 11 employees bavarian nordic has in recent years moved from being a purely research-based business to also encompassing in-house production and quality control these are areas in which many different staff groups work together and the rapid growth we have seen has made it essential for us to establish a shared identity and culture for the company and its employees for this reason we defined a set of corporate values in and worked to anchor them throughout the organization over the past few years as an example the corporate values are an integral part of both our annual employee performance reviews and job interviews when we recruit new employees in addition we have begun offering a management development course in which our corporate values also play a key role we have also established an hr forum with representatives from the hr functions in all our countries of operation its purpose is to ensure overall coordination of management initiatives and to establish best practices for this field the forum has defined common goals for our work with the corporate values and in we will focus on strengthening our internal communications throughout the organisation diversity as a global organisation we are used to collaborating across national borders and cultures we support a diverse accommodating and non-discriminatory working environment without looking at gender age ethnicity physical impairment religion or sexual orientation and we believe this helps create business value in the company our board of directors discusses the company 's activities every year in order to ensure that the greatest possible competencies exist at all management levels our managers and executives are selected exclusively on the basis of their qualifications and not on gender this ensures that we can provide equal opportunities to both sexes if candidates for the positions have the required professional background the board of directors is our supreme governing body and consists of six shareholder-elected members in all members of the board of directors were men so the board set a target for representation of the under-represented gender 15 equivalent to one person and the target must be met in at the latest the target was set taking into account the composition of the current board of directors and the boards of directors of our peer companies but also considered ensuring continuity on the board of directors which is why the target is considered to be both realistic and ambitious there was no under-representation of men or women among other executive or management staff of bavarian nordic at year-end we will determine the share of male and female managers and executives every year to ensure compliance with statutory requirements see also table 2 training and upgrading of employee qualifications we are an innovative knowledge-based company and it is important for us to attract and retain highly qualified workers also for this reason we want to offer our staff a good working environment that also provides them with development opportunities there are good opportunities at bavarian nordic both for development within a field of work by rotation between production laboratory and office jobs or for development vertically within the management hierarchy as a result we are happy to recruit internally and we focus on staff development potential in our annual employee performance reviews it is crucial that our employees have the necessary tools and techniques to perform well in their jobs now and in the future our goal is as a minimum for our workers and managers to always have the skills to look for and find their own job for this reason we focus on continuing training and education and on upgrading qualifications also those of the many employees who work in the gmp areas furthermore we have allocated additional funds for training and more employees have taken external courses a few have begun taking classes in training or educational programs while continuing to work at bavarian nordic in the first employees at our kvistgaard facility completed training as plant operators and several new participants have enrolled we also regularly hire trainees also graduate work experience trainees contributing to the effort to ensure that university students obtain the competencies required in business and industry we also want to be able to offer relevant student jobs to university students in addition representatives from bavarian nordic regularly hold presentations at a number of colleges and universities as part of the programs offered by those institutions leadership in step with our growth as a company requirements with respect to a visible and competent leadership have also grown and in recent years we have had a special focus on training managers and execu- csr report 12 tives at all levels in we completed a specially designed management development course for all managers and executives of the group employee health and job satisfaction at bavarian nordic we strive towards a good healthy work-life balance and at work we focus on employee health and job satisfaction we do so in a close dialogue between management and employees through a number of established committees including a works council and a health and safety committee on which both management and employees are represented and regularly discuss matters that may have an impact on the wellbeing and jobs of our employees all staff at kvistgaard are included in our corporate health insurance plan which ensures fast and professional help and treatment at private hospitals and from psychologists chiropractors physiotherapists etc. should the need arise we work actively to counteract stress we have a focus on stress indicators in daily absence we have been working actively for several years on dialog-based sickness absence management ahead of legislative trends we generally achieve a quicker return to work by handling each case individually also including an option to return to work part-time or be assigned other tasks at first the goal is to reduce the percentage of long-term absence that is due to sickness which has accounted for a substantial share of all sickness absence in recent years ish law moreover we regularly conduct workplace assessments when observations or changes in working procedures indicate there is a need to do so based on the workplace assessments relevant improvement initiatives are put forward prioritized and translated into action in the various departments in compliance with danish regulations employee representatives and managers have been elected to health and safety groups and a health and safety committee at kvistgaard the health and safety committee meets every quarter to follow up on the action plan in order improve working conditions and safety a good safe working environment the company s occupational health and safety work is different at our different sites to comply with the different countries regulatory requirements we will survey working environment conditions at our kvistgaard facility going forward by conducting workplace assessments every second year which is more frequent than the every three years required by dan- to further improve our health and safety work we hired an ehs specialist at kvistgaard in environment health and safety to provide support in our health and safety work and to coordinate measures concerning health and safety the environment

construction site safety and risk assessment preparations related to the coming production of prostvac in an increase was recorded in the number of occupational accidents with more than one day of resulting absence which also caused an increase in our accident rate although this rate is still lower than the average accident rate for danish companies at kvistgaard where most of the company 's employees work three occupational accidents were reported in and six were reported in germany the accidents were minor ones causing an average of work-related accidents 1.3 days of absence we are very much focusing on reversing this trend by thoroughly investigating the accident causes in order to prevent similar accidents in future as part of our preventive work we have also introduced reporting of nearevents that could have led to an accident we encourage innovative thinking that promotes beneficial change for both the individual and the company our employee philosophy at bavarian nordic we offer a challenging and international working environment in which job satisfaction and personal development have a high priority we are committed to making it a great place to work by empowering our employees to perform their tasks to their own satisfaction while aiming for the success of the company we respect different personalities and cultures and believe the the diversity of our employees

integral part of bavarian nordic 's csr policy we wish to maintain an active dialog with our suppliers about social responsibility and environmental initiatives when setting up our production we mapped out the geographical locations of our raw materials suppliers and found that they are mainly located in north america and the eu which already have a high level of regulation of social and environmental parameters also new potential suppliers are evaluated with respect to their geographical location and thus the risk they represent and an assessment is made as to whether action is necessary in contracts with our suppliers we inform them of our business ethics and our expectations that our suppliers comply with basic ethical social and environmental guidelines in accordance with both good manufacturing practice gmp and our own supplier management system currently in place all our new raw materials suppliers are audited following the initial audit suppliers are evaluated every third year as a minimum either by way of a visit or a questionnaire depending on the situation the audits do not include csr-related issues but they provide an excellent opportunity to talk with the suppliers about their attitudes and practices in the area and also to comment on any problematic issues csr report 15 business ethics bavarian nordic prioritizes business ethics as a natural part of its underlying business concept we want to be seen as credible and reliable in the eyes of our collaboration partners and the rest of the world around us we have developed a code of ethics and business conduct that must be observed by everyone in the company management is obliged to take violations of the code seriously the code of ethics and business conduct contains rules within a large number of areas including compliance with laws and regulations the code also includes the rules and regulations in the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the truth in negotiations act tina that are relevant in connection with the company 's business transactions and negotiations in the united states the company is otherwise committed to cooperating in connection with investigations organized by authorized individuals working on behalf of authorities with legitimate rights conflicts of interest gifts free services and entertainment corrupt practices ethics hotline in the company 's management has decided to introduce an ethics hotline to give employees the opportunity to report possible violations of the code a special work group reporting to the management has been looking at the practical aspects of such a hotline which will be set up in collaboration with a third-party service provider partly to protect the employees who raise concerns and partly to ensure that the necessary investigations are conducted when a concern has been raised and that corrective action is taken if necessary because the ethics hotline may involve reporting personally sensitive data it must be pre-approved by the danish data protection agency we filed an application with the agency in that the agency took longer than expected to process so we expect to have the hotline up and

responsibility is to express a conclusion on the key performance indicators in the csr report based on our review scope of work we conducted our work in accordance with international standards on auditing governing other assurance engagements and additional requirements under danish audit regulation to obtain limited assurance about our conclusion we have obtained limited assurance because compared to a reasonable assurance engagement our work has been limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures copenhagen march 19 deloitte statsautoriseret

substantial improvements in the use of resources and energy per manufactured dose for this reason we elected to present our climate impact as an index figure reflecting the relative energy consumption per manufactured dose our total co2 emissions were down by 9 year on year which was mainly due to a lower level of manufacturing activity our manufacturing efficiency improved again in as a result of a continuing focus on process efficiencies and utilization of resources we also reduced our power consumption with the effect that relative emissions per manufactured dose remained under index 100 2 the kvistgaard facility where our industrial production and many of our laboratory activities take place is also the facility that contributes most to our total carbon footprint the largest source of

increase production efficiency the activities from berlin were transferred to kvistgaard the decline was partly offset by the continuing expansion of our r d department in mountain view primarily as a result of the phase 3 study for prostvac the rate of employee turnover was 19.6 13.7 an increase primarily due to the outflow of employees from berlin the absence rate was 3.9 in which was lower than in the absence rate includes employees at kvistgaard martinsried and berlin the absence rate for kvistgaard was 3.5 3.5 while the combined rate for martinsried and berlin was 4.8 5.7 an improvement mainly due to a lower percentage of long-term absence in there were nine occupational accidents the highest number since although they were minor accidents causing an average of 1.3 days of absence

below all data for resource and raw materials consumption in the manufacture of finished products refers only to the production facility at kvistgaard the facility in berlin was closed by the end of june so data from there only refers to the first six months of the year data was gathered to the extent it was accessible within the boundaries of our existing systems carbon footprint our carbon footprint calculations are based on the standard from and recommendations of the greenhouse gas protocol initiative for calculating an organization s total carbon emissions which include the six greenhouse gasses addressed by the kyoto protocol co2 ch4 n2o hfcs pfcs and sf6 calculated in metric tons of co2 equivalents emissions sources are divided into three scopes direct emissions from activities under the company s control scope 1 emissions from the consumption of electrical power scope 2 and indirect emissions from products and services scope 3 according to the recommendations organizations should report on scope 1 and scope 2 as a minimum and this is what we have decided to do in our carbon footprint statement we have calculated the total carbon emissions from our locations in kvistgaard martinsried berlin and mountain view in we also included the power and heating consumption at our leased laboratories in h√∏rsholm berlin was only in operation during the first six months of the year as no consumption data are available from that location we estimated the figures based on average consumption during the preceding three years indicator reference entities

in h√∏rsholm the carbon footprint for this facility is calculated separately and included in total emissions but is not included in emissions for kvistgaard cf table 1 3 the comparative figure for does not include mountain view 1 2 for other sites the calculations include the following four different types of emissions natural gas and oil this figure is based primarily on current consumption as measured by monthly meter readings oil used for emergency generators is estimated or based on oil purchased greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels are calculated on the basis of an average emission factor fugitive emissions fugitive emissions include co2 from the use of dry ice and co2 gas plus emissions of greenhouse gasses from cooling and refrigeration systems electricity electrical power consumption is based on meter readings recorded at the end of the year the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions from electrical power consumption is based on specific emission factors provided by the power company and an average emission factor for generation of power in germany mileage in km this figure is calculated on the basis of receipts from gasoline companies and in- cludes motor vehicles owned or leased by the company greenhouse gas emissions are calculated on the basis of an average fuel-specific emission factor for ordinary cars in denmark and germany emission factors in calculating co2 emissions specific emission factors based on emissions type and geographic location were used co2 emissions from the combustion of natural gas oil gasoline diesel fuel and lpg and from fugitive emissions were deemed to have a general global effect with minor local differences emission factors from these sources are based on data provided by the danish energy agency however natural gas emission factors for mountain view are based on figures from the pacific gas and electric company a provider of natural gas and electricity in california emissions for locally purchased electricity were determined on the basis of local conditions emission factors for kvistgaard are based on factors for denmark as a whole emission calculations for electrical power at mountain view are based on emission factors provided by the pacific gas and electric company emission calculations for electrical power purchased in csr report 25 germany are based on general german emission factors emission calculations for district heating purchased in germany are based on emission factors published by local district heating companies employee turnover employee turnover is calculated as the number of employees that left their jobs divided by the average number of employees over the course of the year indexed co2 emissions per dose produced co2 emissions per manufactured dose are indexed to and calculated on the basis of the number of batches manufactured translated into the projected number of doses manufactured during the calendar year accidents work-related accident data relates to accidents resulting in more than one day of absence the definition of `` work-related accident '' in danish law is the definition applicable in this document the accident rate is the number of occupational accidents per one million working hours vacation days are not included employees absence absence data includes recorded staff sick days and child sick days leave also maternity and paternity leave is not included in these figures the absence rate was calculated by dividing the total number of days of absence by the product of the average number of full-time employees for the year and the number of work days in the calendar year raw and ancillary materials water water consumption is calculated for the entire kvistgaard facility including laboratories and administrative functions an analysis of wastewater is made once a year the figures in table 4 for phosphorous nitrogen carbon and chlorides are based on these measurements waste waste volumes are calculated based on annual statements from approved waste carriers handling ordinary and hazardous waste raw materials for production are calculated based on the company 's inventory system erp system and figures refer to consumption for the year ancillary materials acids/bases salt and refrigerants are materials sourced during the year and figures are based on invoiced purchases

report 1 a word from the ceo was a strong year for bavarian nordic where a number of significant achievements have helped build a strong strategic foundation for the future we met our financial and operational targets and even exceeded our own expectations as new opportunities surfaced during the year looking ahead the road is full of new and exciting events for bavarian nordic in both the short and mid-term our csr efforts are mainly focused on business relevant cost saving initiatives in our operations as well as our commit- 2 ment to contribute positively to environment and society in we expanded our production facility to accommodate multiple products and manufacturing activities were significantly increased nevertheless we successfully managed to reduce our relative climate impact by more than 20 which is a combined result of implementation of energy saving solutions and better utilization of resources we are also focused on health and employee well-being and were pleased to report a drop in absence rate number of work related accidents as well as employee turnover i would like to thank all bavarian nordic employees involved in all csr initiatives in order to continuously improve different aspects of our operations allowing us to expand our value adding pipeline possibilities paul chaplin president ceo bavarian nordic in brief bavarian nordic is a global company that develops and manufactures innovative vaccines and immunotherapies for the prevention and treatment of life-threatening diseases with unmet medical needs the company 's clinical pipeline focuses on cancer and infectious diseases the primary source of revenue is generated from sales of imvanex¬Æ/imvamune¬Æ a smallpox vaccine approved in eu and canada and supplied to various government stockpiles predominantly the u.s. strategic national stockpile the company s early-stage program for an ebola vaccine was fast-tracked during as the outbreak in western africa continued to rage the vaccine was licensed to janssen a johnson johnson company who made a huge commitment to fight the disease as part of this commitment bavarian nordic was contracted to manufacture up to 2 million doses of its ebola vaccine which also will generate significant revenue prostvac¬Æ is the company s lead immunotherapy candidate in phase 3 development for the treatment of prostate cancer in march a global option and license agreement for prostvac was entered with bristol-myers squibb listed on the nasdaq copenhagen exchange the company has roughly 23 thousand shareholders for more information visit www.bavarian-nordic.com csr report 5 3 bavarian nordic and csr in addition to our annual environmental reporting we began working systematically with other aspects of csr in this work is concentrated on five focus areas our products our environment our employees our suppliers and business ethics to ensure that our csr initiatives are carried out timely and efficiently and to improve transparency on the activities we have established a csr steering committee comprised of senior representatives from core functions in the company in addition to a csr working group comprised of representatives from human resources communications and our environmental health and safety specialist in addition to a general csr policy we have policies in the areas we believe are essential to our work due to the size of the company we do not as yet have an actual suppliers policy but have instead incorporated these elements into our general csr policy neither do we have a policy for human rights but we are aware of and respect the un guiding principles on business and human rights which we will investigate further in relation to our business our csr goals are driven by rational operational measures that support the company 's general strategy of creating a profitable business we are constantly working to identify areas that are crucial to the company 's business and are expected to have a positive impact on performance in working towards the csr targets set reporting principles this csr report was prepared with inspiration from the global reporting initiative gri a recognized framework for sustainability reporting the gri structure includes principles and indicators we use to measure and explain the company s financial environmental and social performance reference to gri indicators included in this report is made on page 20 scope of our reporting in order to focus on business relevance we selected the areas to be reported on based on a principle of materiality we endeavored to include the most important ways in which the company has either a direct or an indirect impact on the world around it our manufacturing facility in kvistgaard denmark where also our headquarters are located is one of the chief sources of our environmental impact and we seek to provide a high degree of transparency by calculating our carbon footprint and reporting environmental data in addition we have included our facilities in martinsried germany research and development and mountain view california usa research and development taken together these facilities employ more than 99 of the group 's staff and are responsible for the greatest share by far of the energy and raw materials consumed by the company non-financial key figures carbon footprint global tco2 carbon footprint production

are important elements of our corporate culture drug development is a highly regulated area in which a strong regulatory regime of inspections and approvals sets a high standard for all areas of our disciplines the pharmaceutical industry works according to gmp 1 gmp includes strict requirements with respect to a product s traceability strength quality and purity which means that quality management is built into each step of the manufacturing process gmp rules are laid down by the danish european and u.s. health authorities bavarian nordic supplies these markets and thus complies with these quality requirements vaccines for infectious diseases the backbone of bavarian nordics business over the past many years has been the development production and supply of a new smallpox vaccine for government stockpiles around the world for use in emergency situations the vaccine is non-replicating thus suitable for persons good manufacturing practice 1 who are not recommended vaccination with traditional smallpox vaccines the vaccine known as imvanex or imvamune has been approved in eu and canada and the company has to-date delivered 28 million doses of the vaccine to our primary customer the u.s. government who also funded the development of the vaccine leveraging on the smallpox vaccine success we began working with the u.s. government in on the development of an ebola vaccine based on our proprietary technology platform mva-bn the rapidly developing ebola outbreak in western africa in forced the summoning of authorities and the industry to assess the ongoing developments of therapeutics to fight the disease and bavarian nordic s ebola vaccine program mva-bn filo was fast-tracked in partnership with janssen due to promising results from animal studies with a combined vaccine regimen of both companies vaccines that had shown complete protection against the ebola zaire strain which is responsible for the current outbreak these promising results led to a license and supply agreement with janssen under which bavarian nordic will manufacture and supply approximately 2 million doses of the vaccine during active cancer immunotherapies help the body to fight cancer immunotherapies belong to a new class of treatment aimed at training the patient 's own immune system to fight cancer we have multiple projects in our pipeline targeted at various cancers prostvac our leading project is in final phase 3 development in an earlier phase 2 clinical study prostvac demonstrated an increased median survival time of 8.5 months for patients with advanced prostate cancer these results are among the best ever demonstrated in this patient group and they have led to the start-up of a global clinical phase 3 study in 1200 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer the study completed enrollment in december and is now awaiting data that could potentially support a marketing authorization for prostvac 8 csr report 5 our environmental work our primary impact on the environment and climate is derived from our production and we endeavor to improve our manufacturing efficiency and processes in order to optimize energy consumption and to minimize emissions and waste we wish to be at the forefront of environmental work and we seek to be so by maintaining a high degree of compliance and systematization in our organization driven by our environment health and safety specialist who proactively works to ensure that we comply with our own as well as external guidelines as required by the authorities we are also actively working with environmental health and safety planning in new building projects this has particularly characterized our work in where our manufacturing was transitioned into a multi-product facility in order to accommodate the production of ebola vaccine prostvac and other future commercial products in addition to our smallpox vaccine which has been produced at the site for several years developments lower relative climate impact despite increased activities our total co2 emissions were only slightly higher by 6 compared to despite significantly increased manufacturing activities as result of transitioning to multiple product manufacturing for the production alone the increase was 11 which are being partly offset by reductions in other areas our relative climate impact from production dropped by impressive 22 in and is result of better utilization of the resources air recirculation helps reduce energy consumption a new building of more than 900 m¬≤ was constructed at the kvistgaard facility as part of the expansion that allows for multiple product manufacturing although this has expanded the total floor area at the site by 11 the overall energy consumption at the kvistgaard facility dropped by 7 in to a level below our targets this is primarily due to new energy saving measures implemented in the new building including heat pump and recirculation of air tracking energy consumption helps defining reduction targets the energy monitoring system that was installed at our kvistgaard facility a few years ago allows us to identify inappropriate consumption of energy and water and thus make improvements in we reduced the water consumption by 4 in the production despite increased activities waste the amount of waste was lower than compared to which is largely attributed to improved manufacturing efficiency and lower scrap rates a mapping of waste at the kvistgaard facility was conducted in this aims csr report to increase the amount of waste for recycling but also helps to improve processes for handling of waste where potential savings can be made energy screening an energy screening of our water cooling systems at the kvistgaard facility was conducted in further energy screenings are planned for key performance indicators established for energy chemicals and production waste in line with our goals for we have established key performance indicators kpis for energy consumption waste recycling and for use of chemicals in the production the kpis are outlined in our goals for the coming years renewed environmental permit based upon the environmental technical description for our facility which we updated in late the danish environmental authorities conducted a reassessment during successfully resulting in a renewal of our environmental permit the permit also covers the new production building which was established as part of transitioning to multiple products locals invited for meeting on ebola vaccine production the company hosted an information meeting on its recent initiation of production of an ebola vaccine neighbors local authorities and media attended the meeting and were well informed about the implications for production of this new vaccine which is harmless to the surroundings like all other vaccines produced by the company goals energy consumption we will work to maintain our annual relative energy consumption kwh per m2 at the danish facility below our target recycling we will work to increase recycling of waste from our production chemicals we will work to reduce the relative consumption of chemicals used in our production 9 10 csr report 6 our employees our employees are our most valuable asset and as an innovative knowledgebased company it is important for us to attract and retain highly qualified workers also for this reason we want to offer our staff a good and inspiring working environment that also provides them with development opportunities at bavarian nordic we strive to maintain a good healthy work-life balance and we focus on employee health safety and job satisfaction we do so in a close dialogue between management and employees through a number of established committees including a works council and a health and safety committee on which both management and employees are represented and regularly discuss matters that may have an impact on the wellbeing and jobs of our employees being a global organization we support a diverse accommodating and non-discriminatory working environment where regardless of gender age ethnicity physical impairment religion or sexual orientation we all aspire to the same objectives likewise we share the same corporate values excellence agility and dedication that have become an important foundation of how we work to achieve both our corporate as well as individual goals developments employee turnover the rate of employee turnover was 13.8 19.6 and compares well to the previous years except for where there was a significant outflow of employees due to closure of the berlin facility whose activities were transferred to denmark as part of consolidation of manufacturing activities in we set a goal for our employee turnover lower absence rate the absence rate was 3.1 in 3.9 which was lower than that of other companies see figure 1 absence was generally lower at both sites where the absence is recorded sickness absence denmark and germany compared to thus our target to maintain the absence rate below 4 was met decline in occupational accidents in there was only one minor occupational accident the lowest number reported thus far the accident rate remains below that of other companies see figure 2 we recently began reporting of near-misses that could have led to an accident thus strengthening the preventative work performed by our health and safety committee in we set a goal for occupational accidents occupational accidents absence rates frequency 6 30 5 25 4 20 3 15 2 10 1 5 0 0 bavarian nordic all companies comparison with di confederation of danish industry statistics for sickness absence all companies bavarian nordic all companies number of accidents per million working hours compared with di confederation of danish industry statistics for work-related accidents all occupational groups csr report gender diversity at management levels we maintained an equal distribution of men and women in managerial positions with 47 and 53 respectively managers and executives are selected exclusively on the basis of their qualifications and not on gender this ensures that we can provide equal opportunities to both sexes if candidates for the positions have the required professional background employee development and training we continued our focus on training and education and on upgrading our employee s qualifications some of our production operators have received in-house training from other departments as part of the transition to multi-product manufacturing some have been trained for work in crossorganizational projects and others have completed external training as plant operators these initiatives help to increase quality of work as well as job satisfaction thereby retaining good employees in california a presentation skill workshop was held in order for employees achieve a higher more polished level of presentation skills whether in a meeting or a large-group presentation leadership training we continued our leadership development with a program for managers in california that focused on priority management objective setting and planning productive- ness delegation coaching and more similar initiatives are planned for for new managers in germany and denmark strengthened internal communications we have focused on strengthening our internal communications throughout the organization apart from the day-to-day information of all employees on relevant issues we have introduced monthly meetings where management representatives present and discuss strategy developments and timely topics with all employees these meetings not only help to improve the information level but also allows for employees to meet with management as well as for the management to better feel the pulse of the organization in addition scientific workshops meetings and webinars are also held regularly to increase the internal knowledge and improve relations across the organization anti-harassment policy introduced an anti-harassment policy was introduced followed up by training of managers which included an introduction of tools to prevent harassment goals occupational accidents in the annual number of occupational accidents should be equivalent or less than the average of the previous three years absence we will work to maintain the annual absence due to sickness below 4 employee turnover in the annual employee turnover rate should be below the average of the previous three years gender diversity at management levels we will work to maintain an equal gender distribution among the managers of the group 11 12 csr report 7 our suppliers our suppliers of raw materials are mainly located in north america and the eu which are areas with a high level of regulation of social and environmental parameters in place in accordance with both good manufacturing practice gmp and our own supplier management system all new raw materials suppliers are audited following the initial audit suppliers are evaluated every third year as a minimum either by way of a visit or a questionnaire depending on the situation the structured audit process helps us to gauge the quality and csr mindset of our suppliers through this close collaboration with our key suppliers we are gaining a deep insight into their business processes and capabilities which provides important learnings for optimizing our own processes minimized environmental impact from raw materials the close collaboration with our key suppliers revealed the possibility to transition to a similar raw-material but one with a better shelf-life less waste and the ability to store the material at higher temperatures lower emissions in general we have optimized the consumption of raw materials and additives in the production thereby reducing the relative consumption on largely all parameters compared to optimized ordering process the transition of the manufacturing facility from one to multiple products has required a review of existing ordering processes through closer planning with our key suppliers we have achieved a more optimal ordering process that helps to ensure timely availability of raw materials for different production campaigns developments flexible suppliers as part of our recently entered partnership with janssen we had to switch to a high production volume of bulk drug substance for our ebola vaccine with very short notice this was successfully achieved due to a high internal flexibility but also the flexibility of our suppliers who understood the importance of helping in a very special situation csr report 13 8 our business ethics bavarian nordic prioritizes business ethics as a natural part of its underlying business concept we want to be seen as credible and reliable by all our stakeholders our code of business conduct and ethics the code describes the ethical requirements for all employees and the board of directors behavior in relation to customers employees shareholders society suppliers and partners the code includes the rules and regulations in the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the truth in negotiations act tina that are relevant in connection with the company's business transactions and negotiations in the united states the observation of the code rests upon all employees and all employees are encouraged to report issues concerns and any breach of the code for this purpose the company has established a whistleblower system ethics hotline developments updated code of conduct the code of conduct was updated providing more detail and better guidelines for the employees the code was presented throughout the organization and by january all employees had acknowledged their acquaintance with the code new employees will receive training in the code as part of their introduction program at employment ethics hotline launched the company launched an ethics hotline to give employees the opportunity to report suspected violations of the code the hotline has been set up in collaboration with a third-party service provider partly to protect the employees who raise concerns and partly to ensure that the necessary investigations are conducted when a concern has been raised goals human rights we will conduct a screening of the un guiding principles on business and human rights 14 csr report 9 independent auditor s report on key performance indicators to the executive board of bavarian nordic a/s we have reviewed the key

bavarian-nordic.com 3 csr report making a difference once a biotech company now a fully integrated vaccine manufacturer the story of bavarian nordic goes back more than 20 years and demonstrates the success of transforming science and technology into a sustainable business focused on the development manufacturing and commercialization of vaccines for the prevention of life-threatening infectious diseases and the treatment of cancer the real transformation though has taken place over just the last few years where we have built our manufacturing facility capable of producing millions of vaccines that could potentially help protect and save people s lives thus contributing to a healthier and safer society that is a worthy mission and while pursuing our strategy and objectives to remain sustainable and grow our business further through continued investments in research and development we recognize the importance of protecting the world around us this commands us to work and act responsibly in all matters and we aim to do this by manufacturing high-quality vaccines working actively and systematically to minimize our impact on the environment and climate maintaining an active dialog with our stakeholders on a local national and global level actively supporting and respecting human rights and labor standards providing a safe and healthy working environment for our staff that includes opportunities for professional and personal development communicating our csr policy to external collaboration partners including our suppliers conducting business according to highest ethical standards these are our overall csr policies which are further specified in relevant areas throughout this report in which we particularly focus on employees environment products suppliers business ethics and human rights our csr goals are driven by rational operational measures that support our general strategy of creating a profitable business we are constantly working to identify areas that are crucial to our business and are expected to have a positive impact on performance in working towards the csr targets set to ensure that our csr initiatives are carried out timely and efficiently and to improve transparency on the activities we have established a csr steering committee comprised of senior representatives in the company in addition to a csr working group comprised of representatives from human resources investor relations communications and our environmental health and safety specialist scope of our reporting in order to always focus on business relevance we selected the areas to be reported based on a principle of materiality we endeavored to include the most important ways in which our company has either a direct or an indirect impact on the world around us our manufacturing facility in kvistgaard denmark where also our headquarters are located is one of the chief sources of our environmental impact and we seek to provide a high degree of transparency by calculating our carbon footprint and reporting environmental data from this site furthermore it represents almost two thirds of our employees in addition we have included research and development facilities in germany and the usa taken together these facilities employ more than 99 of our staff and are by far responsible for the greatest share of our consumption of

report a word from our ceo this is our seventh annual sustainability report in which we account for our environmental and social performance during this period there has been no such thing as business as usual while our strategy and objectives have been clearly defined throughout we have had new opportunities and challenges arising every year requiring us to adjust procedures and processes navigating in this ever-changing environment can be difficult but with highly skilled and adaptive personnel we have come through with great success also in apart from the initial year of reporting where we were only in the early stages as a manufacturing company mostly performing process development and testing showed the lowest climate impact thus far despite increased manufacturing activities we have managed again to optimize our processes which in combination with a better utilization of resources have reduced our overall emissions as well as our water consumption the health and safety of our employees remain areas of high priority and it is highly satisfying that we again did not record any serious work-related accidents in while our overall staff has decreased slightly over the past few years our staff in manufacturing has increased as result of introducing multiple products to mitigate the potential risks associated with the new and highly complex processes we have recently strengthened our safety organization furthermore we have an exhaustive training program for new employees as well as ongoing training of our safety organization to ensure a proactive work that aims to reduce risks of accidents related to our working processes therefore we also see a better and more reliable reporting of health and safety issues causing an unfortunate turn in the statistics for but at the same time providing us a better starting point for addressing these issues going forward in we will maintain a high activity level in production to support various new clinical trials in infectious diseases and cancer we will also continue our preparations for commercial manufacturing of prostvac and finally we will continue production of smallpox vaccine for the u.s. government while manufacturing thus seems to have become an important asset to bavarian nordic this multitude of activities has only been made possible due to dedication from our scientists in the discovery and development of novel vaccines the recent validation of our vaccine technology through partnerships with janssen and bristol-myers squibb will only help to keep our scientists busy in the continued discovery of new vaccines paul chaplin president ceo 5 csr report built on science driven by people our employees are our most valuable asset and as an innovative knowledge-based company it is important for us to attract and retain highly qualified workers for this reason we want to offer our staff a good and inspiring working environment that also provides them with development opportunities at bavarian nordic we strive to maintain a good work-life balance and we focus on employee health safety and job satisfaction we systematically map both the physical and psychosocial working environment so that the necessary preventive steps can be taken for the benefit of both individual employees and the company as a whole we do so in a close dialogue between management and employees through a number of established committees including a works council and a health and safety committee the aims of our general health and safety policy are to regularly train and educate our safety employee representatives so they are updated on the relevant topics and legislation to secure well-functioning and well informed workers and safety committees on all relevant sites to promote awareness of health- and safety-related behavior in all employees as part of their day-to-day work and to produce proactive solutions to potential problems to gradually develop a safety management system to support this proactive safety work being a global organization we support a diverse accommodating and non-discriminatory working environment where regardless of gender age ethnicity physical impairment religion or sexual orientation we all aspire to the same objectives likewise we share the same corporate values excellence agility and dedication that have become an important foundation of how we work to achieve both our corporate as well as individual goals developments maintained absence rate below our targets the absence rate was 3.9 in 3.1 and thus we met our target to maintain the rate below 4 although we note that absence rates among other companies see figure 1 continue to decline we maintain our target of 4 due to the strict regulations that apply to our production which help to ensure our product safety we do not allow our production employees to return to work before they have recovered fully after illness and hence we expect a higher absence rate than that of other companies occupational accidents still below industry averages in the occupational accident frequency rate was 8.2 accidents per million working hours compared to 1.4 in a total of 6 occupational accidents were reported all of which were minor injuries resulting in limited absence from work average absence of 2.7 days compared to 3.0 in per accident while we remain committed to a high level of safety throughout the organization the recent expansion of our manufacturing facility which has increased the number of workers in our production has resulted in more preventative measures as well as more complex procedures thus requiring additional training of both new and skilled employees we furthermore believe that an increased focus on our working environment in particular over the last year has led to a higher and more reliable reporting of accidents than previously the improved reporting not only helps to address actual accidents but also helps to define additional preventative measures based on reporting of near-misses and observations while the accident frequency rate remains below industry averages we maintain a high focus on a safe and healthy working environment in order to identify all relevant measures that help to prevent future accidents higher employee turnover due to reorganization the employee turnover rate was 21.6 13.8 which is higher than we would normally expect this was mainly due to consolidation of our research activities which led to a reduction of staff in california gender diversity at management levels we maintained an equal distribution of men and women in managerial positions with 51 and 49 respectively managers and executives are selected exclusively on the basis of their qualifications and not on gender this ensures that we can provide equal opportunities if candidates for the positions have the required professional background increased focus on psychosocial working environment in addition to the physical working environment we have increased our attention on the psychosocial working environment in as a small organization we must be adaptable to changes and opportunities and therefore it is important that we prepare our employees for managing through changes in order to strengthen their job satisfaction and improve their general wellbeing specifically we have conducted training of our works committee and our health and safety committee offering them tools for managing change and stress for both themselves and 6 csr report their colleagues in addition voluntary meetings for all employees have been held in kvistgaard focusing on changes in a positive perspective training of safety representatives the employee representatives and the employer representatives in the safety organization are offered training regularly in topics related to risk prevention and risk management in the safety organization received training in handling of incidents in addition to the supplementary mandatory occupational health training that included machinery specific risks changes and work planning furthermore priority was given to members of the safety organization for participation in basic fire training employee development and training we continued our focus on training and education and on upgrading our employee s qualifications some of our production operators have received in-house training from other departments as part of the transition to multi-product manufacturing some have been trained for work in cross-organizational projects and others have completed external training as plant operators these initiatives help to increase quality of work as well as job satisfaction thereby retaining good employees furthermore we initiated training for teams with a specific focus on their tasks e.g working on the roof working with hazardous chemicals goals and activities in we plan to conduct workplace assessments focusing on the physical and psychosocial working environment at our kvistgaard site as required by danish law in continuation of these assessments the general wellbeing among all employees will be evaluated globally based on a survey this extra survey will assist us in detecting any areas that could be improved and helps us decide what concrete measures should be made in the future to ensure our employees job satisfaction leadership training the leadership training which was planned for managers in germany and denmark in has been postponed to occupational accidents in we aim to reduce the number of accidents compared to to register at least 20 near-misses and/or observations and to analyze all accidents and at least 75 of the near-misses and observations absence we will work to maintain the annual absence rate due to illness below 4 new procedures and tools as well as increased reporting to managers aims to ensure a more proactive approach for working with absence among employees gender diversity at management levels we will work to maintain an equal gender distribution among the managers of the group sickness absence absence rates 5 4 3 2 1 0 bavarian nordic all companies comparison with di confederation

di confederation of danish industry statistics for work-related accidents all occupational groups 7 csr report caring for the environment our primary impact on the environment and climate is derived from our production and we endeavor to reduce our environmental and climate impact by improving our manufacturing efficiency and processes in order to optimize energy consumption and to minimize emissions and waste our vaccine production facilities and procedures are designed so that viruses do not escape into the indoor or outdoor environment through the air or in our wastewater systematization in our organization driven by our environment health and safety specialist who proactively works to ensure that we comply with our own guidelines as well as environmental protection regulations and relevant requirements as defined by the authorities in general we consider informal visits by the authority as a benefit for information sharing and joint risk perception as we may become aware of issues that we did not consider before we furthermore encourage environmentally aware behavior throughout the company as a whole we wish to be at the forefront of environmental work and we seek to be so by maintaining a high degree of compliance and developments compared to we increased our production activities in mainly as result of the production of mva-bn filo ebola vaccine where we produced and delivered bulk vaccine corresponding to more than 2 million doses to our partner janssen in addition we produced vaccines for multiple clinical trials as well as continued our preparations for commercial manufacturing of prostvac lower overall climate impact despite increased activities despite increased manufacturing activities our total co2 emissions were 12 lower compared to and our relative climate impact from production dropped by impressive 24 as result of further optimizations as well as better utilization of resources energy we basically met our relative energy consumption target kwh per m2 at our kvistgaard facility in as planned we conducted a complete energy screening of the site during the year which helped to identify additional energy-saving initiatives which will be further assesses during reduced consumption and discharge of water we further reduced the water consumption in the production by more than 2 this was a result of the energy monitoring system that was installed at our kvistgaard facility a few years ago which allows us to identify inappropriate consumption of energy and water 1 ghg protocol http //www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/faq scope 3 other indirect emissions such as the extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels transport-related activities in vehicles not owned or controlled by the reporting entity electricity-related activities e.g t d losses not covered in scope 2 outsourced activities waste disposal etc. minimized environmental impact from raw materials we have continued to optimize the consumption of raw materials and additives in the production again reducing the relative consumption on largely all parameters including chemicals compared to increased efforts to reduce indirect emissions while our carbon footprint calculation does not include other indirect emissions as defined in scope 3 by the ghg protocol1 we have increased our focus on outgoing transportation of goods this has resulted in increasingly choosing transportation with couriers through consolidated distribution hubs instead of dedicated cars when allowed by security requirements this aims to reduce our indirect climate impact and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to make further reductions waste the amount of waste was higher than compared to which is largely attributed to higher manufacturing activity while we did not meet our target to increase the relative share of waste for recycling we have continued to identify areas of improvement throughout specifically we have worked to identify additional waste fractions that would allow us to increase recycling through proper disposal of separated waste 8 csr report goals and activities energy based on the energy screening in we expect to prioritize the initiatives that were identified and possibly implement the first projects during to support our goal of maintaining our annual relative energy consumption kwh per m2 at the kvistgaard facility below our target chemicals while we have not set specific targets for reduction of the relative consumption of chemicals used in our production we continue to optimize our processes thereby seeking to improve our production economy a part of these efforts is to avoid any unnecessary use of chemicals and additives we thereby also seek to minimize the amount of waste requiring special treatment waste we will continue our work to increase recycling of waste from our production specifically we have entered into an agreement with a new waste carrier able to handle the additional waste fractions which we identified through product safety product safety is crucial in our business and quality and responsibility are important elements of our corporate culture vaccine development is a highly regulated area in which a strong regulatory regime of inspections and approvals sets a high standard for all areas of our disciplines we work according to good manufacturing practice gmp which are rules laid down by the european and u.s. health authorities gmp includes strict requirements with respect to a product s traceability quality and purity which means that quality management is built into each step of the manufacturing process to-date we have produced and delivered more than 30 million vaccine doses even though largely all these vaccines have been stockpiled for emergency use and thus not have benefited end users yet we and our partners have conducted various clinical trials of our product candidates in more than 10,000 people demonstrating that our vaccine platform technology has a favorable safety profile suppliers in accordance with both gmp and our own supplier management system we perform a risk assessment of all new suppliers of critical materials and equipment used in our production and laboratories suppliers whose products are considered to have a material impact on our products quality and safety will undergo an initial audit followed by an evaluation every third year as a minimum either by way of a visit or a questionnaire depending on the situation the structured audit process helps us to gauge the quality and csr mindset of our suppliers through this close collaboration with our key suppliers we are gaining a deep insight into their business processes and capabilities which provides important learnings for optimizing our own processes our suppliers of raw materials are mainly located in north america and the eu which are areas with a high level of regulation of social and environmental parameters in place 9 csr report business ethics bavarian nordic prioritizes business ethics as a natural part of its underlying business concept we want to be seen as credible and reliable by all our stakeholders our code of business conduct and ethics the code describes the ethical requirements for all employees and the board of directors behavior in relation to customers employees shareholders society suppliers and partners the code includes the rules and regulations in the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the truth in negotiations act tina that are relevant in connec- tion with the company 's business transactions and negotiations in the united states all employees have received training in the code and new employees will receive training as part of their introductory program thus the observation of the code rests upon all employees and all employees are encouraged to report issues concerns and any breach of the code for this purpose the company has established a whistleblower system ethics hotline human rights as outlined in our general csr policy we support and respect human rights our compliance in this area is widely covered by our health and safety policies as well as observance of the national labor laws in the countries in which we operate while the scope of these efforts is mainly directed towards our own employees we seek to conduct our business with third parties in compliance with the principles as well as part of our procurement policies we perform regular audits of our suppliers whom we encourage to act responsibly in all matters relating to csr including observing international human rights also we conduct our clinical trials in a manner that recognizes the importance of protecting the safety of and respecting the research participants we do this by applying the highest legal ethical and scientific standards in addition to complying with applicable laws and regulations developments as planned we undertook a screening in to assess how our business may impact human rights we used a human rights impact assessment tool to assess our level of compliance with the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights ungp in particular focusing on the ungp guidelines for a policy commitment a due diligence process and processes to enable the remediation of adverse impacts caused directly or indirectly by the company goals and activities in we will further evaluate the assessment results in particular focusing on potential adverse impacts in order to determine if additional actions are required the result of this initial screening indicates no actual adverse impacts and only few potential adverse impacts on human rights the potential adverse impacts are primarily related to lack of knowledge or lack of documentation or formalized processes there already seems policy commitment and processes to a certain degree within the three pillars mentioned above 10 csr report independent

the busiest year thus far in our production the transformation into a multiproduct facility has completed and we have manufactured a multitude of vaccines csr report 4 we have leveraged the know-how and expertise derived from many years of experience in manufacturing imvamune smallpox vaccine to expand our facility to produce other commercial vaccines as well as vaccines for clinical trials to support the advancement of our pipeline imvamune remains a core asset which we continue to supply to the u.s. government importantly we are preparing for commercial manufacturing of our prostate cancer vaccine prostvac for a successful product launch if approved in that light it is very satisfying that of all the years we have reported on our co2 emissions was the least impactful both in actual numbers and relatively while it could be expected that our increased activity would entail higher emissions the result is very satisfying and gives evidence of our ability to improve the efficiency in our manufacturing process csr report it is our mission to make significant contributions to improve public health was also a year with significant investments in our pipeline we continue to move forward our prioritized projects cv301 an immunotherapy for lung cancer and mva-bn rsv for protection against respiratory syncytial virus which both represent significant opportunities in areas of high unmet medical need and with our partners we continue to progress our other product candidates in cancer and infectious diseases albeit we continue to grow and mature our company we are still a small organization with an agile mindset that allows us to adapt quickly to changes we had a slight increase in our workforce in particularly in our production as result of increased activity and we decided to close our operations in california to relocate to the u.s. east coast during first half of this will bring us closer to our partners collaborators and influencers in the u.s. but not least also closer to our headquarters and operations in europe thus creating a stronger connection between our people being a company in growth we are not able to make pledges for lowering our overall emissions the activity level in production in will be similar to however we will continue our efforts to minimize our climate impact over time having said that our impact is still modest and reasonable considering our mission to make significant contributions to improve the public health we are striving every day to make new discoveries and develop novel therapies that could help to protect or sustain people s lives with that in mind we believe our science makes the greater impact paul chaplin president ceo 5 how we work with csr once a biotech company mostly focused on r d now a fully integrated vaccine manufacturer the story of bavarian nordic goes back more than 20 years and demonstrates the success of transforming science innovation and technology into a sustainable business focused on the development manufacturing and commercialization of vaccines for the prevention of life-threatening infectious diseases and the treatment of cancer the real transformation though has taken place over just the last few years where we have built our manufacturing facility capable of producing millions of vaccines that could potentially help protect and save people s lives thus contributing to a healthier and safer society that is a worthy mission and while pursuing our strategy and objectives to remain sustainable and grow our business further through continued investments in research and development we recognize the importance of protecting the world around us this commands us to work and act responsibly in all matters and we aim to do this by csr report manufacturing high-quality vaccines working actively and systematically to minimize our impact on the environment and climate maintaining an active dialog with our stakeholders on a local national and global level actively supporting and respecting human rights and labor standards providing a safe and healthy working environment for our staff that includes opportunities for professional and personal development communicating our csr policy to external collaboration partners including our suppliers conducting business according to highest ethical standards these are our guiding principles for working with csr upon which we have formulated our policies which are further specified in relevant areas throughout this report reporting framework since the establishment of our production facility in kvistgaard denmark in 2005 we have been subject to annual environmental reporting to the danish authorities and this has served as a framework for key areas of our sustainability reporting in addition we draw from the most pertinent elements of some of the most widely known csr reporting frameworks globally notably the global reporting initiative gri and the united nations global compact ungc csr organization to ensure that our csr initiatives are carried out timely and efficiently and to improve transparency on the activities we have established a csr steering committee comprised of senior representatives in the company in addition to a csr working group comprised of representatives from human resources investor relations communications and our environmental health and safety specialist 6 how we work with csr continued scope of our reporting in order to always focus on business relevance we selected the areas to be reported based on a principle of materiality we endeavored to include the most important ways in which our company has either a direct or an indirect impact on the world around us our manufacturing facility in kvistgaard denmark where also our headquarters are located is one of the chief sources of our environmental impact and we seek to provide a high degree of transparency by calculating our co2-emissions and reporting additional environmental data from this site furthermore it represents almost two thirds of our employees in addition we have included our research and development facilities in germany and the usa which represent the last third of employees and contribute to our global emissions by approximately 25 csr report 7 environment and climate impact our primary impact on the environment and climate is derived from our vaccine production in kvistgaard denmark and we endeavor to reduce our environmental and climate impact by improving our manufacturing efficiency and processes in order to optimize energy consumption and to minimize emissions and waste we wish to be at the forefront of environmental work and we seek to be so by maintaining a high degree of compliance and systematization in our organization driven by our environment health and safety specialist who proactively works to ensure that we comply with environmental protection regulations and relevant requirements as defined by the authorities in general we consider informal visits by the authority as a benefit for information sharing and joint risk perception as we may become aware of issues that we did not consider before we furthermore encourage environmentally aware behavior throughout the company as a whole non-financial key figures environment and climate the presented key figures relate to our production facility in kvistgaard denmark which also comprises our headquarters with administrative functions and quality laboratories however we also present our global emissions which include all other

from production waste waste from production recycling csr report 8 environment and climate impact continued developments production activities were further increased in as we reinitiated production of smallpox vaccines for the u.s. government but also continued production of vaccines for our increasing number of clinical trials as well as continued our preparations for commercial manufacturing of prostvac overall we increased our production output by 51 as measured by batches compared to we have continued to optimize the consumption of raw materials and additives in the production again reducing the relative consumption on several para¬≠ meters compared to we remain focused on avoiding any unnecessary use of chemicals and additives thereby also seeking to minimize the amount of waste requiring special treatment based on the energy screening performed in additional csr report energy-saving initiatives were implemented in our production during the year notably we have introduced more energy-efficient light sources implemented natural ventilation in a boiler room and replaced traditional gas boilers with condensing boilers these and additional initiatives have helped to contain our overall energy consumption despite increased activity during the year we initiated construction of a new cold storage facility at the kvistgaard site the facility will be taken into operation in there were two non-material breaches of the environmental terms at the facility one was a damaged filter from a deactivation tank it was assessed to have no impact on the external environment the authorities were informed and the procedure was changed in order to ensure a future lower burden on the filters the second was a noise complaint related to a temporary breakdown of a refrigeration compressor results and targets emissions note 1 despite increased manufacturing activities our total c02 emissions were 13 lower compared to and our relative climate impact from production dropped by impressive 39 reaching the lowest level in both absolute and relative terms since we started our csr reporting these improvements result from a better utilization of the production facility but also from our ability to make further optimizations of the manufacturing process in we expect a similar activity level in production as in and thus do not foresee emission reductions the chart shows the relative c02 emission from production per batch emissions from production indexed with as base year 125 100 75 50 25 9 environment and climate impact continued energy note 2 energy consumption increased by 14 but the relative consumption decreased by 25 compared to while the facility has seen several expansions over the years resulting in a higher base consumption of electricity and heating the variable energy consumption largely depends on the activity level in the production therefore we have abandoned our previous target which was defined as a relative number based on the area of the facility kwh per m2 we will maintain a high focus on energyefficient solutions in all new projects water note 3 given the increased manufacturing activities reductions in the water consumption were not possible in however the relative consumption was lowered by 25 compared to due to better production efficiency while we will continue to monitor csr report for inappropriate consumption and make corrective actions accordingly it is our assessment that the current relative consumption likely can not be further lowered waste note 4 the amount of waste was slightly higher than compared to which is largely attributed to higher manufacturing activity however as we succeeded in implementing new procedures for separation and handling of waste we increased the share of waste for recycling from 9 in to 43 in importantly the fraction of waste requiring special treatment was slightly reduced relative performance in on key parameters 75 50 25 0 25 50

the share of waste for recycling in 10 built on science driven by people our employees are our most valuable asset and as an innovative knowledgebased company it is important for us to attract and retain highly qualified workers for this reason we want to offer our staff a good and inspiring working environment that also provides them with development opportunities being a global organization we support a diverse accommodating and non-discriminatory working environment where regardless of gender age ethnicity physical impairment religion or sexual orientation we all aspire to the same objectives we strive to maintain a good work-life balance and we focus on employee health safety and job satisfaction we systematically map both the physical and psychosocial working environment so that the necessary preventive steps can be taken for the benefit of both individual employees and the company as a whole we do so in a csr report close dialogue between management and employees through a number of established committees including local works councils and a health and safety committee the overall objectives of our occupational health and safety policy are to enable ourselves to control our occupational health and safety risks and improve our occupational health and safety performance in order to eliminate or minimize risks to personnel and guests who could be exposed to hazards associated with our activities to help achieve these objectives we have laid down the following principles risks that might lead to an occupational health injury or ill health have to be assessed in order to determine actions risk mitigation that can reduce the impact or the likelihood adverse incidents are evaluated in order to learn and to consider if changes of the working conditions or the occupational health and safety policy are warranted education and training support the members of the occupational health and safety organization the organization is prepared to respond to any emergency situations and prevent or mitigate associated adverse consequences developments our workforce increased by 7 in primarily as result of increased activity at our kvistgaard site where we as planned conducted workplace assessments among all employees the assessments focused on both the physical and psychosocial working environment and provided important learnings to help mitigate risks through identification of potential issues related to the safety and well-being of our employees based on the output from the assessments the local health and safety committee will develop and implement action plans during a collective agreement was entered with laboratory workers at the kvistgaard site where technicians and production operators were already covered by collective agreements we conducted a global leadership training program the vision of the program was to empower the organization through leadership development and create a common leadership foundation across the organization we maintained an equal distribution of men and women in managerial positions with 48 and 52 respec¬≠ tively while we aim to maintain an equal gender distribution among the managers they are selected on the basis of their qualifications and not on gender 11 built on science driven by people continued results and targets occupational accidents note 5 we recorded just one occupational accident in resulting in injuryrelated absence of only one day this translates into an accident frequency rate of 1.3 accidents per million working hours compared to 8.2 in and thus we met our reduction target the safety organization has continued its focus on reporting and handling of near-misses and observations which we believe has contributed to the overall improvement in safety at our manufacturing site these preventative efforts remain in focus and the safety organization has set specific targets target to maintain the rate below 4 at our kvistgaard site we have previously implemented dialog-based absence management which has proven successful and we expect to roll out this and other management initiatives at our other sites during aiming to reduce illness-related absence for its analytical work and follow-up on reports and observations which aims to eliminate or minimize risks across the site absence note 5 the absence rate was 3.6 in 3.9 and

responsibility are important elements of our corporate culture in accordance with both gmp and our own supplier management system we perform a risk assessment of all new suppliers of critical materials and equipment used in our production and laboratories vaccine development is a highly regulated area in which a strong regulatory regime of inspections and approvals sets a high standard for all areas of our disciplines we work according to good manufacturing practice gmp which are rules laid down by the european and u.s. health authorities gmp includes strict requirements with respect to a product s traceability quality and purity which means that quality management is csr report built into each step of the manufacturing process to-date we have produced and delivered more than 30 million vaccine doses even though largely all these vaccines have been stockpiled for emergency use only we and our partners have conducted various clinical trials of our product candidates in more than 10,000 people demonstrating that our vaccine platform technology has a favorable safety profile suppliers whose products are considered to have a material impact on our products quality and safety will undergo an initial audit followed by an evaluation every third year as a minimum either by way of a visit or a questionnaire depending on the situation the structured audit process helps us to gauge the quality and csr mindset of our suppliers through this close collaboration with our key suppliers we are gaining a deep insight into their business processes and capabilities which provides important learnings for optimizing our own processes our suppliers of raw materials are mainly located in north america and the eu which are areas with a high level of regulation of social and environmental parameters in place 13 business ethics human rights bavarian nordic prioritizes business ethics as a natural part of its underlying business concept we support and respect human rights our compliance in this area is widely covered by our health and safety policies as well as observance of the national labor laws in the countries in which we operate we want to be seen as credible and reliable by all our stakeholders and we are committed to work actively against corruption in all its forms our code of business conduct and ethics the code describes the ethical requirements for all employees and the board of directors behavior in relation to customers employees shareholders society suppliers and partners the code includes the rules and regulations in the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the truth in negotiations act tina that are relevant in connection csr report with the company 's business transactions and negotiations in the united states but equally relevant in other markets where the company operates all employees receive yearly training in the code and new employees will receive training as part of their introductory program thus the observation of the code rests upon all employees and all employees are encouraged to report issues concerns and any breach of the code for this purpose the company has established a whistleblower system which provides our employees with an opportunity file reports in a secure and confidential manner while the scope of these efforts is mainly directed towards our own employees we seek to conduct our business with third parties in compliance with the principles as well in we performed a screening to assess how our business may impact human rights and it indicated no actual adverse impacts we will continue to monitor for potential adverse impacts in order to determine if additional actions are required as part of our procurement policies we perform regular audits of our suppliers whom we encourage to act responsibly in all matters relating to csr including observing international human rights also we conduct our clinical trials in a manner that recognizes the importance of protecting the safety of and respecting the research participants we do this by applying the highest legal ethical and scientific standards in addition to complying with applicable laws

costs was not obtained in ÔÇ∑ supply of goods to customers through the company s stores is to be increased annually by 6 in there was continued focus on using ao s 49 nationwide stores as a focal point for the collection of pick-up orders in the local areas this resulted in a substantial increase in the number of stock item deliveries through our stores the number of pickup orders increased from 144,518 in to 173,033 in it is an increase of 19.7 and the target has therefore been met ÔÇ∑ at r√∏rvang total energy consumption including electricity heat and fuels is to be reduced annually by 6 was the year where ao s new large high-bay warehouse finally came into operation and overall seen it resulted in an increase in the electricity consumption of 2 seen in isolation the investment in led lighting led to a fall in the electricity consumption of 3 even though there were more hours with full warehouse lighting in due to the introduction of night shifts after the installation of energy improvements such as a building envelope and radiant heating panels the total heat consumption fell by 3 unfortunately it was not enough to meet the target of a 6 reduction in the total energy consumption ÔÇ∑ the company is to recycle more than 70 of its total waste ongoing target ao continues to have full focus on the sorting of waste and in it was decided that ao should be a bit more ambitious in this respect and therefore the waste sorting target was raised from 60 to 70 according to the waste analyses for the company recycled 72 of its total waste at the logistics centre in horsens which is a decrease attributable to the reduced activity the central warehouse in albertslund recycled 87 of its total waste mainly due to the taking over of activities previously undertaken in horsens a generally increased market activity and a major increase in the number of stored water supply and drainage products which require significant quantities of wood that can be recycled the recycling target of more than 70 has therefore been more than successfully met in there will be extra focus on the energy consumption as ao is in the target group for the new energy audit imposed on all companies with more than 250 employees this means that ao s stores are to be certified according to iso 14001 in the spring of this will create a new focus on the company s total energy consumption diversity in management in keeping with danish act no 1383 of 23 december on the introduction of rules regarding target figures and policies for the gender composition of the supreme governing board and the reporting thereof the company has on 1 april decided that in connection with the ordinary general meeting in at the latest the shareholder-elected board members are to be composed of at least 20 women all shareholder-elected board members were re-elected at the ordinary general meeting in at the time of the presentation of the financial statements the target figure has therefore not been reached in addition the company has drawn up a policy to increase the share of the underrepresented gender at the company s other management levels in denmark the goal is to achieve a share of female managers of at least 10 in at the latest the current gender composition of the company s other management levels is 9 women and 91 men 6 women and 94 men 19 of the company s employees are women as a result of internal recruitment of managers the number of female managers increased during the year through the above-mentioned policy the company seeks to create a good and versatile workplace that promotes equal career opportunities for both women and men and it is therefore estimated that the share of the underrepresented gender at the company s other management levels will increase in the long term the company has decided not to have any other policies and targets regarding diversity"
69,Brd A & O Johansen,CSR,2016,statutory report on corporate social responsibility cf section 99a of the danish financial statements act this statutory report on corporate social responsibility for br√∏drene a o johansen a/s hereinafter called ao is part of the management s review in the annual report for and covers the accounting period from 1 january to 31 december ao wants to comply with current legislation and international conventions in the countries and communities where we operate ao operates primarily in denmark and the greater part of our purchases is made in the eu we respect and comply with competition rules environmental legislation labour market legislation agreements and safety requirements and other regulations that provide the framework for how we conduct business in the countries where we operate in addition we want to be a responsible company that on a general level supports the un global compact s ten principles on human rights labour standards the environment and anti-corruption in our work with corporate social responsibility we have chosen to focus primarily on the environment and social conditions and working conditions as the most significant areas this choice has been made on the basis of an analysis of csr related risks and our social impact in the local communities in which we operate in our opinion all the countries in which we operate are well-regulated in relation to environment social conditions working conditions human rights and anti-corruption on this basis we have concluded that we can make a positive difference both internally and externally primarily by working with the environment social conditions and working conditions are the obvious choice due to the fact that we consider our employees our greatest asset and the reason for our success and results the csr policies are controlled by ao s board of directors who once a year follow up on financial and non-financial key figures ao s business model ao is a knowledge-based it and logistics enterprise with a wide technical range of heating plumbing and sanitary ware products electrical equipment and components water supply and drainage products and tools the key concept is one-stop shopping where the customers are offered a complete product range as part of a collection and delivery system which is supported by strong it and online trading systems ao s business is directed toward the professional market the diy market and the private market through an efficient storage and distribution system ao is able to effect prompt deliveries to professional tradesmen private individuals municipalities utilities and public institutions sales are channelled through ao s stores edi trading platforms and competency centres where customers may place orders and get advice and direction as well as offers over the phone and through various webshops ao s business model is illustrated below environment policy ao has an environmental policy which focuses on the continued improvement of the company s environmental performance ao acknowledges that an active consideration for the environment is important and through its purchases investments and other operations of the business we will help to protect the environment so that the development of society may take place in a sustainable way we focus on reducing the most significant environmental and climate impacts and has identified ÔÇ∑ ÔÇ∑ ÔÇ∑ transport costs and deliveries to customers through ao stores waste reduction and recycling energy consumption electricity and heat as the most significant read more in the company s environmental policy at ao.dk https //ao.dk/om-ao/fakta-omao/csr/miljopolitik/ in danish only environmental initiatives and actions including risks ao s administration and central warehouse in albertslund are environmentally certified according to ds/en iso 14001 the same also applies to the rental and service functions and the storage facilities at herstedvang 6 in albertslund and all ao stores ao s environmental objectives for were defined as ÔÇ∑ the supply of goods to customers through the company s stores is to be increased annually by 6 related transport costs are to be reduced accordingly ÔÇ∑ the development of transport costs is equal to or less than the development in revenue ÔÇ∑ total energy consumption at ao s administration and storage facilities electricity and heat is to be reduced annually by 6 ÔÇ∑ ao recycles more than 70 of its total waste in there will be extra focus on the energy consumption as ao is in the target group for the new energy audit imposed on all companies with more than 250 employees this means that ao s stores are to be certified according to iso 14001 in the spring of this will create a new focus on the company s total energy consumption every year in june ao reviews the environmental initiatives and actions made by the company in the past year and new objectives for the coming year are determined the results of the review are reported in an environmental statement the environmental statement for is available at https //ao.dk/om-ao/fakta-om-ao/csr/miljopolitik/ in danish only in addition ao encourages both suppliers and customers to reduce their environmental and climate impacts for suppliers this is done prior to the conclusion or renewal of a business agreement by means of an environmental assessment of each individual supplier based on a simple questionnaire when a business agreement has been concluded the supplier commits himself to observe ao s supplier conduct for suppliers which is available at https //ao.dk/om-ao/investor-relations/in-english/company-profile/suppliercode-of-conduct in addition see below among other things ao encourages its store customers to use the wuppi scheme for the recycling of pvc products ao does not have any formalised processes for due diligence regarding the environment but evaluates potential environmental consequences in connection with all new major investments new locations transport methods/patterns or the like and include them as an integral part of the basis for decision ao has identified the most significant risks related to the environment and climate as being energy consumption in the form of electricity and heat waste and recycling and transport it is therefore not surprising that these three areas have priority in our work to minimise environmental risks environmental key figures and results for the company s environmental objectives and actions are reported in the annual environmental statement as ao is part of the target group for the new energy audit imposed on all businesses with more than 250 employees all ao stores were certified according to iso14001 in the spring of this has created a stronger focus on the company s total consumption of energy and in the second half of an agreement was concluded with energidata regarding registration and control of the energy consumption in the individual ao stores in denmark the registered data will be used to check up on the local consumption of electricity heat and water a nationwide agreement on waste collection was also concluded in in addition to the central warehouse in albertslund and the logistics centre in horsens the agreement covers all stores data will be collected to make the total quantities of waste visible including recycled materials thus facilitating a more detailed and local follow-up in the second half of ao tested a delivery collection system in k√∏ge where the customers were able to pick-up ordered goods in the store 24 hours a day if the concept involves less direct deliveries to the customers and more or major deliveries to the stores it is expected that the concept can contribute to a reduction in total transport costs for both ao and its customers the concept will be evaluated in with a view to implementing it in all of ao s stores in the company achieved the following results transport ÔÇ∑ in there was continued focus on using ao s stores as a focal point for the customers to collect pick-up orders thus enabling the company to use its transport capacity more effectively and to reduce the number of direct transports to the customers in the number of pick-up orders increased by 14 compared with this increase also has to be seen in proportion to a revenue increase of 9 the objective for has thus been achieved ÔÇ∑ in total transport costs increased by 13 whereas the increase in revenue constituted 9 the reason is among other things a larger share of online orders combined with a marginal decrease in purchase order sizes basket size the objective for has therefore not been achieved waste ÔÇ∑ in focus was also on waste separation with a view to recycling as much as possible of the total amount of waste among other things systematic sorting of disposable pallets has been established so that they can be either reused or sold the total amount of waste in albertslund and horsens declined by 18 in 84 86 of the total waste in horsens and albertslund was recycled the company s objective to recycle more than 70 of the total amount of waste generated has therefore also been achieved in energy consumption ÔÇ∑ in the energy consumption at r√∏rvang was affected by a major warehouse renovation which took place during most of the second half of and involved an installation of a mini-load system this meant that large parts of the warehouse were transformed into a building site resulting in extra energy consumption in the total energy consumption decreased by 4 compared to and the goal of a reduction of 6 has therefore not been achieved the result is however considered satisfactory in consideration of the warehouse renovation we are generally satisfied with the results achieved in in we will focus on having waste separation and energy consumption measured in ao s 49 stores work expectations for in our focus on transport waste and energy consumption will continue in order to minimise our environmental and climate impact we expect that the agreement with energidata regarding the measurement and registration of local energy consumption will increase our employees focus on consumption and contribute to the preparation of action plans for the reduction of total and local consumption in addition we expect that the nationwide agreement on waste collection will give a total view of ao s amount of waste waste separation and recycling and be instrumental in targeting the local performance the environmental objectives for are the following transport ÔÇ∑ the development of product deliveries to customers via our stores is equal to or larger than the development in revenue ÔÇ∑ the development in transport costs is equal to or less than the development in revenue waste ÔÇ∑ a recycling rate of more than 70 of the total waste generated in our central warehouse logistics centre and stores ÔÇ∑ launching of a benchmarking database on waste and recycled materials for the 49 individual stores energy consumption ÔÇ∑ total energy consumption in ao s administration and central warehouse electricity and heat is to be reduced by 6 compared with ÔÇ∑ disclosure of energy consumption benchmarking data for each individual store data on electricity and heat consumption will be collected from all 49 stores ÔÇ∑ disclosure of the energy consumption in certain central warehouse and office sections in order to clarify the relationship between revenue and energy consumption and to implement energy saving measures social conditions and working conditions policy ao attaches great importance to diversity at all levels it is company policy to secure that ao is a good and versatile workplace that promotes equal career opportunities regardless of gender age ethnic origin religion sexual orientation or political opinion this applies both in connection with recruitment and promotion what matters the most to us is skills both human and professional in keeping with danish act no 1383 of 23 december on the introduction of rules regarding target figures and policies for the gender composition of the supreme management body and the reporting thereof the company has set target figures for the supreme management body and prepared a policy to increase the proportion of the underrepresented gender at the company s other management levels in denmark see the statutory report on the gender composition of management at https //ao.dk/globalassets/1-om-ao/investor-relations/english/financial-statements/2016/statutoryreport-on-gender-composition-2016.pdf it is ao s plan that the gender composition at the company s management levels shall reflect the overall gender composition of the workforce both at board level and at other management levels in ao s opinion it will strengthen the business and its results in the short run as well as the long run ao has no written comprehensive policy regarding social conditions and working conditions management believes that ao¬¥s intentions and policies are communicated to each individual employee through the daily management the employee handbook and the policies contained herein and the work of the working environment committee on these grounds we believe that there is no need for a comprehensive policy for the area social and employee-related initiatives and actions including risks every day we have great focus on the individual employee s development and well-being it is provided through attentive day-to-day management and annual staff development interviews where development on both the personal and professional level job content and advancement and the employee s relation to and well-being in ao are discussed on basis of the above an individual plan for the individual employee is prepared we are aware of the fact that not all have equal opportunities and we seek to rectify this through the creation of flex-jobs and jobs on special terms and by offering work ability testing in cooperation with the local authorities this makes sense both in relation to our role in the local community and in relation to those of our employees who no longer have the opportunity to work on the same terms as before for the same reason we have a senior policy that gives our employees the opportunity in good time to plan their retirement and the content of their last years at work so that the job is adapted to the possibilities and wishes of the individual employee workplace assessments are conducted on a regular basis where both the physical and psychological environment are in focus on the basis of these assessments a comprehensive plan for the entire company and a more detailed plan for each individual department are drawn up the working environment committee also has strong focus on employee safety as a result there is follow-up on occupational injuries and sickness absence the inspection reports of the danish working environment authority are examined closely and when needed action plans are prepared to comply with enforcement notices if any as the employees are ao s most important asset and vital to the success and growth of the company the most important risks are naturally associated with working conditions ao considers the risk of being unable to retain competent employees and the risk of being unable to recruit the necessary resources and skills as the largest risks ao seeks to respond to this by having strong focus on the development and well-being of the employees and as one of the largest distributors in this line of business by being wellknown and visible in the industry annually we employ 10-15 trainees in order to make sure that we at any time have skilled employees trained within the industry in ao s objectives and key figures for the most significant social conditions and working conditions were as follows training and gender composition ÔÇ∑ average number of course days 2.2 days we want to maintain a high level of individual competency development to us it is important that that the employees skills are developed so that their full potential is used and their value on the labour market is strengthened ÔÇ∑ the gender composition at other management levels not including the board of directors constitutes 10 women and 90 men in the long run we want that the gender composition at all management levels shall reflect the overall gender composition of the company s workforce in our opinion it will strengthen the activities of the company and its results working environment ÔÇ∑ number of occupational injuries per 100 employees 4.0 occupational injuries hereof at least 50 involving less than a day s absence we focus a lot on providing a healthy and secure working environment with focus on the prevention of accidents and injuries ÔÇ∑ sickness absence 3 we want a good working environment with high job satisfaction and low sickness absence ÔÇ∑ green smileys from the danish working environment authority at all locations meaning that no enforcement notices have been issued ao places great emphasis on the working environment it is therefore important to us that we meet the rules and regulations of the danish working environment authority and that we do not receive any enforcement notices in keeping with danish act no 1383 of 23 december on the introduction of rules regarding target figures and policies for the gender composition of the supreme management body and the reporting thereof the company has set target figures for the supreme management body and other management levels see the statutory report on the gender composition of management at https //ao.dk/globalassets/1-om-ao/investorrelations/english/financial-statements/2016/statutory-report-on-gender-composition2016.pdf the above-mentioned policies and actions are an integral part of our day-to-day management/culture and are developed concurrently with ao s strategies key figures and results for social conditions and working conditions in in we have worked on many fronts with social conditions and working conditions it has not been possible to measure many of the initiatives but all have contributed to securing good working conditions and the well-being of the individual at the workplace the following results have been achieved in connection with the measurable initiatives training and gender composition ÔÇ∑ average number of course days per employee not including billigvvs 2.3 days 2.2 days thus the number of course days has increased 5 compared with the objective has therefore been achieved ÔÇ∑ the company s gender composition at other management levels not including the board of directors constitutes 9 women and 91 men against an overall gender composition in ao of 18 women and 82 men other management levels 9 women and 91 men and an overall gender composition in ao of 19 women and 81 men however the average proportion of women participating in management courses was 14 in and we hope that this will have an indirect influence on the proportion of women at other management levels in the coming years working environment ÔÇ∑ number of occupational injuries per 100 employees 3.0 occupational injuries hereof 47 involving less than a day s absence 4.7 occupational injuries per 100 employees hereof 50 involving less than a day s absence in the number of occupational injuries was reduced by 35 which is very positive considering the fact that there was a considerable amount of construction work at the central warehouse in albertslund and that the warehouse contained more products than usual due to the transfer of stock from the logistics centre in horsens both elements have contributed to clutter increased traffic and challenges in connection with the separation of walking and driving traffic in spite of the above the objective for the reduction of occupational injuries has been achieved in ÔÇ∑ sickness absence 3.1 2.8 in sickness absence was negatively affected by a few employees on long-term sick leave the objective for has therefore not been met ÔÇ∑ we have obtained green smileys from the danish working environment authority at all locations in we received a single enforcement notice from the danish working environment authority and it was complied with immediately the objective of not receiving any enforcement notices has therefore not been met we are satisfied that the implemented initiatives and actions in have resulted in the fact that the set targets for the average number of course days and the number of occupational injuries and sickness absence have been achieved in essentially the gender composition at other management levels is unchanged compared to consequently we will make a review of the planned actions and initiatives for with a view to estimating whether further initiatives have to be made in order to achieve a future gender composition at all management levels that reflects the overall gender composition of the company s workforce in we will closely monitor the working environment especially in the individual stores and make sure that the rules and regulations of the danish working environment authority are fully complied with work expectations for in our focus on the employees well-being and development will continue among other things a workplace assessment for administration employees in albertslund was conducted at the end of and the information from this assessment is expected to be used in a concrete action plan for in addition workplace assessments are of course conducted in the individual stores central warehouse and logistics centre on a regular basis the objectives for are the following training and gender composition ÔÇ∑ average number of course days per employee 2.2 days in there will be continued focus on individual competency development so that ao s high level is maintained even after the merger with billig vvs aps ÔÇ∑ unchanged gender composition in the company but with an increase in the proportion of women at other management levels not including the board of directors to 11 women and 89 men working environment ÔÇ∑ the number of occupational injuries is to be reduced by 10 to 2.7 occupational injuries per 100 employees ÔÇ∑ sickness absence is to be maintained at 3 in initiatives for the reduction of sickness absence will be implemented among other things by means of a quick followup on employee absenteeism ÔÇ∑ green smileys from the danish working environment authority to all locations no enforcement notices respect for human rights policy ao wants to comply with current legislation and international conventions regarding human rights in the countries and local communities where the company operates we have assessed that we only operate in countries where human rights are an integral part of the countries local legislation and where this legislation is both recognised and respected by both businesses and the civilian populations we have therefore chosen not to have an actual policy for human rights and in our view we do not encounter any direct risks related to human rights in our opinion our present policies and practices regarding working conditions are in compliance with locally and internationally recognised human rights and we refer to the above-mentioned paragraph regarding social conditions and working conditions where our policies values actions objectives risks and results are described in detail we are however aware of the fact that our trade with suppliers may constitute a potential risk of abusing human rights primarily in connection with direct and indirect purchases made from countries where local legislation on the area is not clear or where such legislation is not recognised respected and enforced on these grounds we have drawn up a supplier code of conduct which is described below under the paragraph headed csr and business partners anti-corruption and bribery policy ao wants to comply with current legislation and international conventions regarding sound business practice in the countries and local communities where the company operates we have assessed that we only operate in countries where rules against corruption and bribery are an integral part of the countries local legislation and where this legislation is both recognised and respected by both businesses and the civilian populations we have therefore chosen not to have an actual policy for anti-corruption and bribery and in our view we do not encounter any major risks related to corruption and bribery we do however recognise that the boundaries may be blurred even in a well-regulated country like denmark consequently we have internal rules and procedures to ensure independence from customers and suppliers and to regulate areas like supplier and customer events including gifts and to ensure the compliance with competition legislation in force in no targets related to anti-corruption and bribery were determined and no activities were made no activities are planned for but we regularly assess the need for it we are however aware of the fact that our trade with suppliers may constitute a potential risk in relation to corruption and bribery primarily in connection with direct and indirect purchases made from countries where local legislation on the area is not clear or where such legislation is not recognised respected and enforced on these grounds we have drawn up a supplier code of conduct which is described below under the paragraph headed csr and business partners csr and business partners when we trade with suppliers we are aware of the fact that we may be challenged in connection with our wishes and policies regarding the environment social conditions and working conditions human rights corruption and bribery in order to obtain an overall picture of ao s risk in relation to the procurement of goods we track on a regular basis ao s purchases by country of origin in ao s purchases of goods were divided up by country of origin in the following way other countries 3 china 8 denmark 35 denmark europe china europe 54 other countries we assess that our risk is relatively limited and that it relates primarily to purchases from china and other countries outside of europe corresponding to approximately 10 of ao s purchases from all suppliers on these grounds we have drawn up a supplier code of conduct which is discussed with the supplier prior to the conclusion of a business agreement or in connection with the renewal of an agreement and which is an integral part of the business agreement the code of conduct contains provisions regarding the supplier s and the subcontractors compliance with internationally recognised rules on labour standards human rights environment and bribery and corruption the code of conduct is adopted by the board of directors and is available at https //ao.dk/om-ao/investor-relations/in-english/company-profile/supplier-code-ofconduct/ through our discussions and our code of conduct we hope to inspire and motivate our suppliers to set objectives and work with csr through their activities but as of yet we do not require any reporting in we will continue to monitor and assess the need for further action in this area
70,DFDS,ANN,2007,"emissions more sustainable transport co2 is the most common greenhouse gas and the volume emitted rises or falls proportionally with fuel consumption the most effective manner of reducing co2 emissions is therefore to reduce the consumption of bunkers per transported unit reduction of bunker consumption a project to reduce bunker consumption launched at the start of included a number of technical and operational initiatives as well as more exact measurement of consumption technical initiatives included for example improved engine efficiency and use of energy recycling of excess water and better management of onboard energy consumption operational initiatives included changes to the ships service speeds and the regulation of departure and arrival times in order to reduce the service time which in turn reduces bunker consumption in reductions in the region of 2‚Äì3 per sailed nautical mile were achieved in energy consumption and also therefore in emissions large-scale operations provide advantages for the environment in the longer term the dfds fleet will move towards bigger ships for commercial and environmental considerations the concentration of freight volumes on larger but fewer vessels will reduce energy consumption and emissions per transported unit sulphur content reduced like all other forms of transport shipping has an impact on the environment ships are powered by bunkers fuel oil that emit co2 nox and particles of sulphur into the atmosphere when burned antifouling paint can include hazardous heavy metals and sewage from vessels can add harmful nutrients to the marine environment in addition ships can cause noise pollution especially while in port ballast water in intercontinental ships can also contain alien plant and animal species so-called invasive species dfds s over-arching goal for its environmental work is to develop the operation of our ships and other activities towards consumption of less energy and less impact on the surrounding environment compared to the transport capacity the amount of sulphur particles emitted by ships engines depends on the volume of fuel consumed and its sulphur content in dfds s primary geographic areas of operation the baltic sea and the north sea new international legislation has reduced the sulphur content of bunkers to 1.5 compared to the previous level of 4.5 it is expected that the move towards bunkers with a lower sulphur content will continue over the next few years antifouling paint dfds is in the process of replacing the fleet s antifouling paint with a new type of silicone-based paint this is not only environmentally friendly but also reduces the ships friction in the water so energy consumption and consequently emissions are reduced the previously used types of antifouling paints which contained tin and emitted environmentally damaging heavy metals into the marine environment are no longer permitted sewage emissions dfds ships are fitted with biological cleansing units that biodegrade the sewage generated by onboard water consumption the sewage is then collected in tanks and discharged away from coastal and particularly sensitive marine areas in order to put as little strain on the marine environment as possible new procedures including pumping sewage onshore are expected to be introduced as appropriate units are set up to receive the waste and as improved cleansing and storage facilities are developed on new ships ballast water ballast water from ships can transfer alien species invasive species from one ecosystem to another causing an imbalance in the local marine environment dfds s ships are not covered by the ballast convention due to their smaller size and as they mainly operate in marine areas with closely related ecosystems the problem of transferring alien species between different ecosystems must be considered extremely limited less noise pollution dfds is actively making efforts to reduce noise pollution from ships calling at and docking in ports in areas with noise-sensitive environments in particular work is being done on technical improvements in the form of noise insulation for engines and ramps efforts are also being made to reduce noise by changing routines in addition noise pollution in general will decrease in the future as noise reduction is an important consideration in the construction

strategic development that the company is and is perceived to be an attractive and challenging workplace with this in mind an upgrade of the hr sector was initiated as part of dfds s improvement and efficiency programme the go forward plan the current personnel department was thus in expanded to include an hr-development function and a new hr director has been recruited in order to embed hr work at management level and in company strategy the hr director is also a member of executive management closer co-operation across the company as a consequence of dfds s new strategy from routes to networks the business structure was changed from two divisions to five business areas a significant element of this strategy is a greater degree of exchange and transfer of knowledge and skills both between the activities in the individual business areas and between the business areas the objective is to improve the overall competitiveness of the route network as such an important job for hr in the future will be to help communicate strategic goals and values about closer interaction between all parts of the organisation for example the expanded hr organisation includes four managers who act as partners to the business areas in order to implement the strategy s goals and values job satisfaction and results as well as underpinning the strategy s goals and values a primary objective for hr is to increase staff job satisfaction commitment and efficiency this is based on the principle that job satisfaction generates positive results and that positive results generate job satisfaction in addition the upgrading of hr reflects the need to adapt to general development tendencies in the outside world including a closer focus on human-resource management greater social responsibility

we will disseminate knowledge of our environmental policy among our staff and management in order to ensure a higher degree of awareness about environmental issues we will constantly develop and extend our knowledge and technical expertise in order to ensure continual progress towards more sustainable operations laws and regulations the marine environment is protected by both national and international laws and regulations we respect and support the continued development of measures designed to facilitate progress towards more sustainable shipping emissions co2 is the most common greenhouse gas and the volume emitted rises or falls proportionally with fuel consumption the most effective means of reducing co2 emissions is therefore to reduce the consumption of bunkers per transported unit reduction of consumption of bunkers dfds has initiated a project designed to reduce the consumption of bunkers and therefore emissions of co2 into the atmosphere the project consists of a whole series of technical and operational initiatives as well as the ongoing registration of consumption technical initiatives include for example improved engine efficiency the recycling of excess heat and better management of onboard energy consumption the operational aspect involves changing departure and arrival times in order to reduce the ships service speed as much as possible which will therefore reduce the consumption of bunkers the consumption of bunkers was lowered by approximately 4 in than in concentration of volumes provide environmental advantages in addition the group s long-term goal is to move the fleet towards bigger ships concentrating freight volumes on larger but fewer vessels will also reduce energy consumption and emissions per transported unit targets for reductions since dfds has been operating with a five-year target to reduce emissions of co2 by 10 sulphur the amount of sulphur particles emitted by ships engines depends not only on the volume of fuel consumed but also on its sulphur content in 2006 following international legislation the permitted sulphur level in fuel oil for vessels in the baltic sea and the north sea was reduced to 1.5 compared to 4.5 elsewhere the targets are regularly reassessed and the imo has set a new limit for sulphur content from the limit will be 0.1 in the baltic sea and the north sea compared to 0.5 elsewhere concerted efforts are also being made to find alternative means of reducing ships sulphur emissions one possibility is to install scrubbers in the ships funnels which strip the sulphur out of waste gas dfds is taking part in a development project for a newly designed scrubber which will be installed on a north sea freight ship in summer the scrubber method offers certain advantages as uncertainty exists about the availability and reliability of supplies of fuel oil with a maximum sulphur content of 0.1 as well as about the price level a scrubber will make it possible to purchase oil with a higher sulphur content in addition provisional test results suggest that the method may have additional environmental advantages as it also removes particles from the waste gas antifouling paint the previously used types of antifouling paints which contained tin and emitted environmentally damaging heavy metals into the marine environment are no longer permitted dfds is currently replacing its antifouling paint with a new type of silicone-based paint this is not only environmentally friendly but also reduces the ships friction in the water which in turn reduces energy consumption and emissions sewage emissions dfds s ships are fitted with biological cleansing units that biodegrade the sewage generated by onboard water consumption the sewage is then collected in tanks and later discharged away from coastal and particularly sensitive sea areas which minimises the impact on the marine environment as appropriate units are set up to receive the waste and as improved cleansing and storage facilities are developed on new ships dfds expects to introduce new procedures including pumping sewage onshore dfds annual report 4 environment 45 reduction of bunker consumption in noise future work on the environment dfds is actively involved in efforts to reduce noise pollution from ships calling at and docking in ports in areas with noise-sensitive environments in particular technical improvements are being developed in the form of noise insulation for engines and ramps attempts are also being made to reduce noise by changing routines wherever possible noise will be easier to address in future as architects will focus on noise reduction in the early stages of vessel construction work on reducing the environmental impact of the group s activities will continue as the environmental policy is developed as part of this process work has commenced on co-ordinating efforts across the business areas and in the different countries in order to ensure a coherent and consistent approach to environmental work several subsidiaries now have their own environmental certification the eventual aim is to collate certification in order to achieve quantifiable objective indicators of progress towards an increasingly sustainable company at group level information in order to improve environmental awareness dfds issued the information pack dfds the environment to all members of staff in it describes the group s environmental policy and outlines initiatives to reduce the company s environmental impact the pack also describes ways in which individual members of staff can help to reduce the impact on the environment 46 hr report dfds annual report human resources the staff and management s competences and commitment are crucial to dfds s ability to compete effectively ongoing development of the company s human resources is therefore an important element in dfds s strategy from routes to networks hr work aims to help increase the satisfaction commitment and productivity of the staff as part of this work a comprehensive satisfaction analysis was conducted in autumn in general the study revealed widespread well-being and loyalty to dfds but it also revealed a desire for greater opportunities for personal development and career planning this underlines the need for the work currently being done on providing a greater range of hr services for development training and further education recruitment work will be a top priority in the next few years as demographic developments are expected to lead to greater competition for trainees and other young people dfds plays an active role in the danish shipowners association s blue denmark project which promotes the opportunities and advantages of careers in shipping its activities include publicising the options for overseas employment management positions and training management development a greater degree of uniformity will be sought in management development across all of the business areas although the manager s job is to generate results this can only be achieved with the help of a team of competent staff who are able to work together engage in dialogue and transcend business areas the manager delegates challenges and takes decisions in a two-week training programme called zoom will be introduced it will provide basic management training with the primary focus on interpersonal communication skills enhancement for individual staff members success is rooted in competence dfds s starting point is that the individual member of staff wishes to develop personally and improve job skills on the one hand this improves the individual s contribution to the financial performance of the company on the other it also improves the opportunities available to individual staff members skills are enhanced through for example courses coaching delegating responsibility and assessing the way in which work is organised the dfds academy in the longer term an academy will be set up to promote training and educational activities and to ensure that these are co-ordinated across the different parts of the company social relations hr work also includes the development of social policies that deal with and provide support to staff with alcohol drug stress and other problems for example an agreement has recently been reached on health insurance information hr also involves making sure that staff receive quick and clear information about changes that impact upon their working conditions employment or on the state of the company in general dfds human resources dfds s hr department put a great deal of effort into the implementation of dfds seaways improvement plan which reduced the number of jobs but ensured a future business platform hr s role was to keep individual members of staff informed during the process and to retain an overview of the overall implementation of the plan in order to ensure that the process was as painless as possible for staff closure of the bergen route and adaptation of the land-based organisation the decision to close the bergen route meant redundancy for approximately 270 members of staff on a passenger ship and 70 in the headquarters and agency hr co-ordinated the redundancies in compliance with the national labour-market regulations in denmark norway and england co-ordinated information was provided both on land and on board the ship managers and staff from the hr department served redundancy notices redeployed staff to other ships and briefed the crew change of management structure and industrial-relations agreements on board during this phase of the improvement plan the aim was to increase flexibility on board the two passenger ships on the oslo route a more simple management structure was also introduced and commercial responsibility was further decentralised on all ships in order to restructure operating costs by changing the staffing principles hr re-negotiated the existing agreements with the danish trade unions 3f privat service hotel og restauration and dansk s√∏ restaurations forbund in future the catering function will consist of three groups a full-time crew a flexible crew that can transfer between ships and part-time workers who will be called in for unusually busy sailings for example during weekends and holiday periods the new principles represent a considerable improvement in our ability to tailor staff levels to suit the number of passengers on board implementation of the model would not have been possible had the trade unions not fully understood its necessity the new structure therefore helps to pave the way for a significantly more positive trend in both passenger activities and future employment levels
72,DFDS,ANN,2009,"42 environmental report dfds annual report environmental report csr environmental policy n n n we are committed to improving our operations and activities on an ongoing basis in order to reduce our energy consumption and our impact on the environment we will regularly record and analyse our energy consumption and environmental impact and disseminate knowledge of company environmental policy among our staff in order to ensure a high degree of awareness about environmental issues we will continuously develop and extend our technical expertise in order to ensure constant progress towards more sustainable operations most of dfds impact on the surrounding environment is associated with the operation of ships and therefore the environmental work is focused on reducing emissions as well as developing and implementing new environmental technology the marine environment is protected by national and international laws and regulations and dfds respects and supports the continued development of rules designed to make shipping more sustainable in the future reducing emissions dfds is focused on reducing emissions of harmful substances from ships engines using bunker in particular the work is directed at cutting emissions of co2 nox sox and particles into the atmosphere co2 in dfds set a target of a 10 reduction adjusted for capacity changes in emissions of co2 over a five-year period bunker consumption and emissions are measured continuously on all ships and the results are distributed throughout the fleet in bunker consumption was approximately 13 lower than in however most of this decline reflects the reduction in the number of sailings as capacity has been adjusted to lower demand in the transport market in order to distinguish the streamlining of bunker consumption from fluctuations in capacity consumption and therefore emissions are quantified per transport unit measured per transport unit bunker consumption and emissions in were reduced by 2.7 compared to and by 4.5 compared to dfds is therefore well on its way towards the goal of a 10 reduction in co2 emissions over five years the reductions in emissions can be attributed to dfds bunkersaving programme one element of which is cutting speed a key factor in reducing consumption and emissions to this end projects have been implemented to ensure faster transhipment in ports reducing port time and allowing sailing time to rise other initiatives include op- average consumption of the total fleet g/gross tonnage/nautical mile g/gt/nm 6,3 6,2 6,1 6,0 5,9 5,8 5,7 5,6 5,5 q1 q2 q3 q4 q1 q2 q3 q4 q1 q2 q3 q4 timising engine power and efficiency better voyage planning utilisation of waste heat and frequent hull cleanings to reduce water resistance information and motivation another major factor in this work is motivating staff to contribute to energy savings in order to increase motivation information is distributed about the environmental policy and objectives and its emission-reduction initiatives this is done on a regular basis through internal communications that prioritise environmental issues as well as through special bulletins about environmental initiatives a prize of dkk 50,000 is awarded each quarter to the ship s crew whose efforts have resulted in the largest reductions consolidation around larger ships the most effective way of reducing energy consumption and therefore co2 emissions is fleet renewal modern ships engines utilise energy more efficiently and carry more freight using fewer but larger ships in the ro-ro ships tor ficaria tor begonia and tor freesia were each extended by 30 metres which increased freight capacity from approximately 3,800 lanemetres to approximately 4,600 lane metres despite a capacity increase of over 20 the ships energy consumption only increased marginally while co2 emissions were reduced significantly per lanemetre sulphur sox ships emissions of sulphur are dependent on the amount of oil burned and the sulphur content of the fuel oil in two directives issued by the imo and the eu regarding the use of low-sulphur bunker come into force in the baltic sea and the north sea both of which are designated as ecas emission control areas one directive came into force in early limiting the sulphur content of bunker to a maximum of 0.1 while in port the second directive comes into force in early july and relates to a reduction of the sulphur content in bunker from 1.5 to 1.0 for shipping in the dfds annual report environmental report 43 comparison of bunker

content in bunker to 0.1 in new environmental technology technologies are also being developed to reduce the sulphur content of bunker on board ships dfds is collaborating with aalborg industries and man diesel to develop a so-called scrubber that can remove 98 of sulphur and 70 of the particles from emissions in one such scrubber which consists of approximately 30 tons of heavy plant will be tested as part of the exhaust system on tor ficaria if it lives up to expectations the scrubber will be a significant tool for reducing emissions of sulphur and particles particularly in urban areas the method may also be an alternative to using bunker with low sulphur content as the scrubber is expected to be able to reduce sulphur emissions to at least the same level nox ships engines expel varying degrees of nox nitrogen oxides from combustion these emissions are caused by the combustion temperature and newer engines are designed to operate at temperatures that reduce nox emissions are therefore reduced on modern ships like tor fionia tor jutlandia tor corona and tor hafnia nox emissions are a particular problem in and around ports ships calling at terminals close to urban and residential areas in oslo and copenhagen therefore use catalytic converters to purify smoke from their auxiliary engines which produce power for onboard consumption another way to reduce emissions of harmful substances while in port is to use land-based sources of power this is only possible in ports that provide power through special coupling points on the quay this possibility is currently being assessed e.g in gothenburg in collaboration with the port company at the same time several options are being evaluated for environmentally friendly onboard power generation certification dfds has subsidiaries in several countries in northern europe and does not currently have joint environmental certification for the whole group but various forms of certification in the various companies dfds has therefore decided to attain joint iso 14001 environmental certification the process has already started on the ro-ro routes from gothenburg to great britain norway and the continent once this work has been completed the certification will be gradually extended to other parts of the group environmentally friendly scrap it is dfds policy to only sell ships for scrap when it can be guaranteed that the scrapping will be in accordance with national and international legislation and in accordance with the intentions of the hong kong convention agreed under the auspices of the imo in october the latter is an as yet unratified international regulatory framework designed to ensure responsible scrapping of ships it is expected to come into force in dfds supports this convention and other initiatives that in the meantime ensure that ships are scrapped in a responsible fashion in relation to both the surrounding environment and the working environment this policy formed the basis for the sale in early of a ro-ro ship tor anglia for scrap to the environmentally certified jiangmen yinhu shipyard in china battery-powered eco-friendly canal boats dfds subsidiary dfds canal tours operates tour boats in the port of copenhagen and the canals in the centre of the city the engine noise and exhaust fumes of the boats place a strain on the surrounding urban environment and dfds has decided to develop and deploy a battery-powered boat which is recharged at night when the proportion of environmentally friendly produced electricity is highest the first of these emission- and noise-free boats has been delivered and will be operational from the start of the season if the el-boat lives up to expectations ships of this type are expected gradually to replace the existing boats other priorities work is also being systematically carried out on the processing of waste and sewage from ships under the rules of the countries in which they dock in addition further work is being done to reduce noise during calls and stays in port 44 hr report dfds annual report human resources csr employees skills commitment and wellbeing are crucial to dfds success the development of human resources and welfare at work are therefore important strategic foundations for the company it is the people that distinguish the successful company from the less successful one our professional and social skills along with a constant focus on business results are what makes the difference. henrik holck executive vice president hr management development dfds management programme focuses on developing the individual managers skills through an internal training program called zoom the programme was developed by corporate hr and tailored to suit both the composition of the management team and dfds general situation zoom consists of two modules the first is an intensive course of theory and practical teaching that focuses on the role of the manager communication dfds strategy for staff development and exchanges of knowledge and experience between different areas the programme also includes input from and dialogue with group management including the ceo and hr director about the company s goals the second module consists of practical training it is important for this programme that each team comprises leaders from various fields including land- and sea-based positions as well as from the different northern european countries that make up dfds geographic business area the purpose of the modules is to equip managers with a greater knowledge and understanding not only of the professional work environment but also of its social and psychological aspects their own role as managers and their colleagues situation in addition a number of targets and opportunities serve to develop the individual employee in relation to dfds goals and strategy dfds managers have to generate job satisfaction great job satisfaction generates better results and even greater success‚Ä¶ henrik holck executive vice president hr in approximately 115 managers participated in the zoom course split almost equally between managers of sea-based and landbased positions efforts were made to ensure representation from all functions including managers from the deck and engine crews in 120 managers are expected to take part an increasing proportion of whom will be from outside denmark employee wellbeing an important goal for dfds is that employees thrive in their jobs and that the individual employee experiences that dfds is a workplace that offers good conditions and opportunities for personal development in co-operation with external suppliers extensive studies are conducted at regular intervals to monitor staff wellbeing in about 75 of staff took part in the survey the results of which will be used as a basis for further work to improve and develop dfds as a workplace the study was conducted during the economic crisis of after changing market conditions necessitated reductions in staffing levels notwithstanding this difficult background the survey results showed a generally high level of job satisfaction that was only marginally below the level for in general satisfaction and motivation were high scoring 5.2 compared to 5.3 in out of a maximum 7 loyalty to dfds scored 5.9 out of a maximum 7 which was on a par with satisfaction with immediate line managers was generally high 5.7 against 5.8 in although the study revealed the need for improving efforts to increase individuals opportunities for professional and personal development further development the survey from provides the basis for the further development of dfds as a workplace in in addition to identifying areas for improvement at group level the study also provides results for individual business areas and departments these results are communicated by the management of the business areas to the individual departments for information discussion and follow-up each department then submits specific development plans for areas identified as in need of change or development a follow-up wellbeing survey will be conducted in autumn other courses as well as the management-development programme a number of statutory and safety-training courses are held each year for staff at sea as well as focus on provision of relevant technical-training courses in some departments employee development interviews all employees participate in development review meetings with their immediate line manager once a year these reviews focus on the individual employee s situation including the relationship between their job expectations their skills and their actual duties the interview also covers the employee s performance in relation to the demands of the job and their jointly agreed goals for the year dfds annual report hr report 45 recruitment information new employees to dfds are often recruited locally partly through recruitment agencies in the various countries partly via the

dfds is part of blue denmark a joint maritime industry project under the auspices of the danish shipowners association blue denmark aims to highlight the many good jobs management positions and development opportunities in the maritime industry its target audience primarily consists of young people dfds strives to provide employees and managers with quick open clear and credible communication about its development strategy especially with regard to changes that may affect individual employees and the reasons for those changes the goal is for changes and new initiatives to be communicated directly to employees via internal media or meetings before the news is broken by external media or spread by rumour in late dfds concluded an agreement which is expected to be approved in q2 to acquire norfolkline making optimal use of both organisations strengths is a prerequisite for the future success of the combined entity the merger of the two organisations will therefore entail a significant focus on hr in order to ensure continuous transparent and credible internal communication about the integration process for both norfolkline and dfds staff training of apprentices and trainees every year dfds trains apprentices in economics as well as shipping administration and travel and this is an important investment in our future employees these two-year programmes attract large numbers of applications and include practical experience and international cooperation shipping apprentices for example spend a year at offices abroad where they gain personal experience of

management tools hr has played an important role in planning the integration process and helping to design the new organisation tools were developed for management to provide them with the necessary support and techniques to ensure a fair and realistic assessment of the potential candidates for posts in the new organisation the tools were also intended to ensure that dfds would be able to retain key employees and to prepare the company s management team for change management support for employees made redundant as an inevitable result of the synergies generated by integrating the two companies the size of dfds workforce was reduced in in this context an important hr responsibility has been to secure the principles conditions and terms of the redundancy schemes and to support departing employees in their job-seeking endeavours and prepare them for their future careers with these goals in mind dfds offered these employees appointments with a so-called outplacement company providing support and tools for job seekers a prerequisite was obviously that the employee in question was willing to accept this help joint personnel policies the integration process is ongoing and is expected to run until the end of hr s role in this will be to continue to support staff and managers in the process by aligning hr processes and policies across the organisation the direct results of this work include joint evaluation processes carried out for land-based staff across the group and the introduction of common personnel policies hr system as part of the integration process a project has been initiated to develop a common it-based hr system initially the work will involve an analysis of the features that a future it system should possess management training and cultural integration one of the main tasks associated with the hr integration of dfds and norfolkline is to integrate the two corporate cultures an important tool in this cultural integration is the dfds group s management training programme ‚Äò zoom in which dfds managers with roots in either the former norfolkline or the former dfds organisation can jointly develop as managers and acquire tools to motivate and inspire their staff 79 managers participated in zoom in and 120 will participate in to emphasise the great importance that dfds places on developing management skills and the task of cultural integration members of the group executive management participate in the programme in which they talk about strategies and objectives as well as expectations towards dfds managers the management training programme is evaluated on an ongoing basis and an improvement was achieved in the course of the year saw a growing understanding among the participants of the need for cultural integration between norfolkline and dfds as well as between sea and land in order to create a new corporate culture focusing on adaptability and performance management means taking responsibility and taking responsibility also means taking responsibility for your employees not just in their results but also in their behaviour and the culture they create the most important management tool is the

and skills enhancement for dfds staff that is why each employee is required to have a personal development plan every year all dfds employees are offered a so-called staff development interview which focuses on the individual employee s situation the relationship between job requirements and skills and the actual tasks and the way in which the employee functions in his or her job dfds is a service organisation and in the course of the year various service courses professional courses and statutory courses were held including safety training for employees a special initiative in was a development project for employees working in the galleys of the passenger ships crown of scandinavia and pearl of scandinavia in which they were given an opportunity to develop their skills and motivation through training courses held in co-operation with the hotel and catering school here the galley staff learned about the latest developments in the arts of cookery and baking including molecular cooking and sushi the project was popular among the employees and will continue in students and trainees training young people is an important investment in the future each year dfds provides trainee courses in finances shipping office work and travel these two-year programmes are popular and all participants receive a thorough training including practical experience with

work is therefore focused on reducing emissions from ships as well as on developing and implementing new environmental technology for use at sea environmental work at sea the marine environment is protected by national and international laws and regulations and dfds respects and supports the continued development of rules designed to make shipping more sustainable reducing emissions dfds is focused on reducing the emission of harmful substances in connection with the use of fuel by marine engines in particular the work is directed at cutting emissions of co2 nox sox and particles into the atmosphere bunker consumption per nautical mile for the dfds fleet 2007-2010 average fuel consumption g/gt/nm co2 fuel oil consumption is measured daily on all ships and is reported and analysed continuously with a view to drawing up reports on consumption trends for each ship each route area and the fleet as a whole in dfds set the goal of reducing co2 emissions by 10 over a five-year period based on consumption per capacity unit measured in gt gross tons per nautical mile 6.2 in the consumption of bunkers per gt per nautical mile was 3.6 lower than in excluding norfolkline since consumption has fallen by 7.9 and dfds is thus well under way to achieving the goal of a 10 reduction in energy consumption over five years in this context it is important to emphasise that the measurements are calculated per capacity unit as the total consumption changes every time ships are added to the fleet or laid up or routes are acquired or sold total consumption thus fell markedly from to as a result of lower activity during the financial crisis while consumption rose overall in due to the acquisition of norfolkline and the consequent expansion of the fleet and increased activity in the market the reductions in fuel consumption and thereby emissions can be attributed to dfds bunkersaving programme one element 6.4 6.0 5.8 5.6 5.4 5.2 q1 q1 of which is reducing ship speed which is a key factor in reducing consumption and emissions while taking into account the need to maintain an efficient sailing schedule in addition projects have been initiated to ensure faster transhipment in ports thereby reducing time spent in port and allowing sailing time to be increased further initiatives include optimising machinery and engine power and better voyage planning using new technology that calculates the most energy-optimal route with the help of information on wind ocean currents water depth wave height and direction efforts are also being made to reduce the amount of ballast water kept on board and to optimise the ship s trim taking account of draught and speed on two passenger vessels new propellers are being installed with a modern design that is q1 q1 q4 optimised for the speed of the route other initiatives include utilisation of waste heat and frequent hull cleanings to reduce water resistance together with a range of measures to cut electricity consumption in lighting heating and ventilation on board information and motivation another major element in these efforts involves motivating staff to save energy through more appropriate behaviour and the use of new technology motivation is encouraged by distributing more information on environmental policies and goals and by involving on-board managers in the drafting of objectives resources and plans structured sharing of knowledge and best practices is also utilised with the aim of reducing energy consumption dfds annual report consolidation in larger ships the most effective way to reduce energy consumption and thereby co2 emissions is to replace older vessels with new ships equipped with modern more energy-efficient engines and to carry freight on fewer but larger ships in the ro-ro vessels tor ficaria tor begonia and tor freesia were extended by 30 metres which increased their cargo capacity from approximately 3,800 lane metres to approximately 4,600 lane metres despite a capacity increase of more than 20 the ships energy consumption increased only marginally while co2 emissions per lane metre have been significantly reduced sulphur sox the amount of sulphur emitted from ships is dependent on the amount of fuel oil burned and the sulphur content of the oil in two directives entered into force issued by the imo and the eu respectively concerning the use of low-sulphur fuel in the baltic sea and north sea both of which have been designated ecas emission control areas from 1 january the maximum permissible sulphur content of fuel oil used during port calls has been 0.1 as a result sulphur emissions to the environment during port calls have been reduced to very low levels from 1 july the maximum permissible sulphur content in fuel oil was reduced from 1.5 to 1.0 for shipping in the baltic sea and north sea generally remarks on future sulphur regulations it has also been decided to introduce a new set of regulations from 1 january which will further reduce to 0.1 the maximum permissible sulphur content in fuel bunker for ships throughout the baltic sea and north sea environmental policy 31 dfds supports general initiatives which aim to reduce emissions of harmful substances into the surrounding environment but it is the view of dfds in common with other operators in the baltic sea and north sea that the planned regulations to come into force in would in their present form bring about several undesirable consequences which were not taken into account when these regulations were adopted the considerable price difference between fuel oil with 1.0 and 0.1 sulphur content respectively will impose extra costs on shipping of such a magnitude that a number of routes operating in competition with land-based transport corridors are likely to close consequently a substantial proportion of the volume currently being transported by sea will thereafter be transported over land an environmental analysis conducted on behalf of the danish shipowners association shows that by far the greatest impact on sulphur emissions is achieved by reducing the sulphur content in fuel from 1.0 to 0.5 while the extra benefit of further lowering the sulphur content from 0.5 to 0.1 is extremely limited at the same time the cost of fuel oil rises exponentially for oil with 0.1 sulphur dfds therefore wishes the forthcoming regulations to be revised so that they will not have the undesirable side effect of shifting large volumes of freight transport from sea to land dfds together with the danish shipowners association and other operators in the baltic sea and north sea is conducting dialogue with the relevant authorities on this issue new environmental technology technology to reduce the sulphur content of bunker fuels on board ships is also under development dfds is collaborating with aalborg industries and man diesel to develop a so-called ‚Äò scrubber which so far has been produced in a single test model this test model is an approximately 30-ton installation built into the exhaust system of tor ficaria where in preliminary tests it successfully removed almost 100 of the sulphur and 70 of the particles from emissions the technique may provide an alternative to the use of bunkers with low sulphur content as the scrubber is expected to be able to reduce sulphur emissions to at least the same level the test period has not yet been concluded and the scrubber is still under development scrubbers can not however be used on all ships and the device is not expected to be ready for use before nox marine engines expel varying amounts of nox nitrogen oxides during combustion the amount emitted is dependent on the combustion temperature and newer engines are designed to operate at temperatures which reduce nox emissions are therefore lower on modern vessels such as tor fionia tor jutlandia tor corona and tor hafnia nox is a particular problem for local areas near port terminals for which reason ships calling at terminals close to urban and residential centres in oslo and copenhagen use catalytic converters to clean the exhaust gases from their auxiliary engines which generate electrical power on board six vessels built in flensburg in 2003 and 2004 also have auxiliary engines equipped with catalytic converters another way to reduce emissions of harmful substances while in port is to make use of land-based electrical power which can only be done where special power couplings are available on the quay this possibility is currently being assessed e.g in gothenburg in collaboration with the port company concurrently with this several options for environmentally-friendly on-board power production are currently being evaluated certification dfds has subsidiaries in several northern european countries and does not currently have common environmental certification for the entire group but various forms of certification in the various companies dfds therefore aims to establish a joint environmental certification responsible scrapping it is dfds policy to sell ships for scrap only when it can be guaranteed that the scrapping will take place in accordance with national and international legislation and in harmony with the intentions of the hong kong convention agreed in october under the auspices of the imo the latter is an as yet unratified set of international regulations aimed at ensuring responsible ship scrapping in future and is expected to enter into force in dfds supports this convention and other initiatives which in the meantime are designed to ensure that ships are scrapped in a responsible manner with regard to both the natural environment and the working environment this policy was the basis of the sale in early of a ro-ro ship tor anglia for scrapping at the environmentally-certified jiangmen yinhu shipyard in china"
74,DFDS,ANN,2011,"cr report cr report corporate responsibility at dfds dfds has taken the first steps to unite corporate responsibility cr and operations to create value for our stakeholders and our company executive message dfds is responsible for many employees their working conditions their safety and their health at work we help to safeguard the infrastructure and supply of goods we are responsible for our passengers safety for our customers freight and for operating as responsibly as possible in relation to the environment we are responsible for managing the investments made in dfds and much more our responsibility is recognised in a range of policies covering these areas in this our first comprehensive report on cr we present policies actions and our progress covering our corporate responsibility efforts hopefully our commitment will come through in this report and at the same time improve the transparency of our work we aim to improve continuously from here step by step that is the dfds way we aim to create value for stakeholders through being a good ‚Äò corporate citizen and we want all dfds citizens from the board to individual employees to contribute actively by making responsibility part of their daily working life. niels smedegaard president and ceo our new approach to corporate responsibility we have embarked on a journey to manage cr risks and opportunities systematically a clear strategy has been set with targets for short and medium-term performance improvements andwe are committed to working with our stakeholders to reach these targets our cr strategy the ambition of our cr strategy is to create and protect value for our stake- 40 holders supporting dfds position as a preferred supplier and employer our ‚Äò roadmap to creating value for dfds and its stakeholders from cr involves working with others we engage with policy makers for example on sulphur emissions we participate in international industry forums on security and safety we work with suppliers for example on efficient bunker refuelling and we are managing community relations such as around our rotterdam terminal see below for more information on who we engage with the issues that are important to them and what we do and plan to do about them all of our cr efforts depend on the collaboration of our colleagues across the company on land and sea without them little can be achieved but in order to harness the collaborative energy reliable processes and systems must be in place over the past two years we have strengthened our capacity for cr in our operations by sharing best practices and improving internal communications on cr an example is the emerging human resources hr management system which will allow more systematic management of people policies and goals another example is the new supply chain management database which will allow us to refine our understanding and partnerships relating to key risks and opportunities in the value chain an executive cr strategy workshop was held in november key topics were the structure cr-work measurability and transparency and integrating cr into daily operations while creating business value there is scope for innovation and we found that we engage with external parties on many issues relating to cr a comparison with peer companies of performance on five key cr issues showed that dfds is well positioned for future development of cr dfds annual report governance of cr to govern dfds cr strategy relating to stakeholder identification reviewing stakeholder relationships and an overall cr policy a new cr corporate governance has been launched with arrangements including new cr committee comprising five senior people responsible for driving and managing cr at dfds niels smedegaard cel is the overall sponsor of the new committee the executive management committee ecm sets the long term ambition with our cr committee driving the programme clear terms of reference for the committee are being developed it will meet at least quarterly and will invite external stakeholders to two of these meetings the chairman of the cr committee will report progress twice yearly to the ecm and annually to the board of directors the members of the cr committee will what are our key cr issues scale to deliver cr security of employees customers and passengers management including fair employment terms greenhouse gases customers on cr issues cr report discuss and make decisions on key cr topic areas such as human resources procurement environment health safety ethical conduct the objectives of the committee will be to drive forward the development of cr policies commitments and goals regular stakeholder mapping and engagement cr issues prioritisation annual cr reporting and the assessment of signing up to the un global compact which dfds expect to do in working with stakeholders creating value from cr for dfds and its stakeholders involves stakeholder engagement processes working with others and being accountable a stakeholder is a person or organisation who we influence or who can influence us including voiceless ones such as the environment and future generations working with our neighbours our rotterdam terminal is next door to a residential area we used to receive about 30 complaints a month from local residents noise and road traffic movements can be a nuisance we set out to explain more about our role in the port and what we are doing we launched a local community newsletter in for some 2,000 residents to keep them informed of our latest developments as a result across complaints dropped from around 30 per month to just a handful and some months none at all our new cr governance therefore builds on engaging with external stakeholders dialogue and collaboration can help tackle cr challenges such as emissions control and fair labour conditions collaboration can create opportunity systematically understanding the changing requirements of customers regarding wider issues can help differentiate a transport supplier for example open engagement with employees can yield productivity improvements consideration of the way we interact with ports logistics hubs and local communities can protect commercial value and reputation board of directors executive management who are dfds stakeholders and what do they expect of us the

implementation and monitoring of safety standards safety processes build on continuous improvement and sharing of best practices in our approach to managing health and safety h s employees passengers freight customers and regulators are key stakeholders corporate safety and security objectives and requirements are determined by national and international regulations under the international safety management ism code and the international ship and port facility security code isps all maritime safety measures and security factors must be reported for all ships on an ongoing basis and all ships must report any incidents on board this can be anonymously under a ‚Äò no blame policy according to safety guidelines in our logistics business we are guided by industrial and highways regulations as standard the ism code aims to ensure that all relevant standards are respected and that safety contingency plans work this applies to safety equipment safe ship construction management procedures training of the crew drills document control and formal safety monitoring structured management reviews and auditing 1 the ism code also requires a designated person ashore to ensure safe operations and a link between the shore-based management and the captain and crew onboard safety and security audits are held on all ships in the fleet at least once a year findings are shared to promote best practice in addition inspections are also carried out as a separate task during the year dfds health safety and environment policy revised in strives to deliver improvement through active demonstration of commitment and leadership at all levels in the shipping and logistics businesses this means practicing what we preach where all managers behave in a way that demonstrates safety and accountability our security management is governed by the international ship and port facility security isps code which helps protect against terrorist attacks and other disruptions shipping and logistics are subject to security inspections on a regular basis audits are held in conjunction with safety audits the fleet regularly takes part in exercises with different countries emergency services in order to train staff exchange experiences and ensure the ships are prepared for any eventuality we monitor accidents incidents and nearmisses at sea and discuss the outcomes of regular audits on a monthly basis this approach involves clear targets for shipping safety at business unit level our marine standards experts people and ships vps and ceo meet to formally review h s and

three hr directors reporting to evp people ships working in partnership with local managers dfds is responsive to local hr management needs based on good levels of engagement and sensitivity to local conditions employees are a key stakeholder and our satisfaction survey is an important tool other engagement includes working with employees on h s committees on work councils and union representation each business unit develops its own training plan for career development and safety training for example many will include contractors particularly in our logistics business with respect to community relations our activities are mainly localised taking root through the energy of the volunteers involved and achieving their own momentum dfds weekly newsletter informs about the community relations projects carried out across the company for all to see often flourishing from grass roots levels these activities demonstrate our values and inspire others to act similarly this is accompanied by a number of corporate initiatives as well as support from the lauritzen foundation progress in people we employ 5,100 people up from 4,862 in the headcount has grown mainly as a result of the full-year effect of the norfolkline acquisition around 46 of these are at sea our head office is in copenhagen across northern europe we operate more than 50 offices we employ 600 officers more than 100

approach dfds environmental policy formulated in commits to the protection and conservation of the environment key commercial risk factors include environmental regulation and energy price inflation and volatility the environmental policy guides on analysis of compliance costs innovation and the corporate response to regulatory change for example with respect to the imo marpol annex vi regulations on reducing sulphur oxide emissions from ships to 0.1 by we are working hard to come up with a technical solution as well as a more balanced political outcome on land we are obliged to meet climate change legislation such as the carbon reduction commitment crc in the uk a government scheme to encourage energy efficiency by medium to large sized electricity users at port facilities and terminals we are improving the energy efficiency of buildings plant and equipment and reviewing on-site renewable energy sources our teams follow procedures to implement environmental management dayto-day as part of customer service we renewed the iso 14001 ems certification at belfast brugge ghent gothenburg and helsingborg logistics operations reduction in co2 emissions 2008-2012 based on a per capacity unit consumption per nautical mile compliance with all applicable regulations is constantly ensured where we operate we also commit to eliminating environmental pollution spills completely we are aiming to maximise resource efficiency cut waste and assess precisely which environmental investments will be practicable the policy also commits to enhancing a culture of environmental awareness where colleagues are comfortable to highlight opportunities to innovate or where things are not going to plan dfds new sustainability and environment department directs environmental efforts at group and local levels ensuring a common quality and the dfds way for working on sustainability and corporate responsibility at sea and on land where we instigate commercial management initiatives we seek to understand and maximise the environmental benefits for example through seaplanner and project headlight in environmental technology investments amounted to dkk 69 million progress in carbon intensity we have achieved the co2 emissions goal one year ahead of schedule the main source of co2 emissions is burning marine fuel oil known as bunker it is measured in

norfolkline vessels total absolute consumption changes over time as the fleet grows or shrinks or according to changing weather conditions on a route for example a relative figure is used to measure consumption to express performance per unit of capacity see p 124 for the dfds fleet list for the data recording system is being developed to include dfds logistics co2 emissions dfds bunker saving programme comprises various projects core to it is ship speed while keeping to sailing schedules work is also focused on faster loading and unloading equipment power efficiency ballast and ship s trim control new energy-efficient propellers waste heat recycling hull cleaning for improved hydrodynamics as well as more efficient heating ventilation air-conditioning and lighting on board energy-efficient route calculation is helped by ‚Äò seaplanner specialist software now installed on 23 dfds ships and which recommends the most energy efficient speed and route new propellers on pearl seaways for example have shown fuel savings of up to 9.6 in the testing period the design is being installed on other vessels to reduce fuel use such initiatives are major investments but the payback period is relatively short due to high oil prices benefits are also derived from working with suppliers to find synergies and improve efficiency our vendor-managed inventory vmi project aims to improve the efficiency of bunker delivery the supplier can save on fuel by optimising its barge movements this partnership project will share information and responsibility with the supplier if the supplier can choose the delivery schedule this will allow flexibility and lower costs for dfds and the supplier on land the port and terminal facilities and distribution hubs are also becoming more energy-efficient we continue to benefit from energy management teams emt at larkhall and belfast for example new more efficient refrigeration was installed with anticipated annual electricity savings of 30 we continue cut fuel get fit in october vilnius seaways won the dfds bunker prize for reducing fuel use and emissions the prize motivates the crew to save fuel the vessel with the best performance wins a cash prize to improve crew facilities onboard the crew decided to use the prize money to upgrade their gym equipment amongst other appliances i think that crew members here and on other ships will be motivated to achieve even more fuel savings in the future said the ship s captain konstantin telik to use more environmentally-efficient trailers and reefers and work with customers such as asda supermarkets in the uk to run double-decker trailers for improved greenhouse gas emissions per carried pallet collaboration continues with suppliers in order to introduce more fuel-efficient trucks in ireland for example euro 5 trucks will cut co2 emissions further compared to the euro 3 vehicles we are working to replicate this throughout the logistics business air emissions the shipping industry is subject to very active legislative developments on air emissions and in particular sulphur content in marine fuel oil is subject to international regulatory controls the north sea and the baltic sea where dfds operates are a so-called sulphur emission control areas secas in  limits for sulphur levels in bunkers oil in secas reducing the sulphur content from a maximum of 1.0 to 0.1 bunkers oil with maximum 0.1 sulphur content is between 40 and 70 more expensive than bunker oil with 1.0 sulphur implying a potential price increase on seafreight of 20-30 which could have a substantial impact on sea traffic in northern europe particularly on routes in direct competition with land based traffic this could lead to a modal shift where sea traffic to a greater extent is replaced by road traffic causing further congestion on european roads thus contradicting the eu policy of moving traffic from road to sea the shipping industry supports stricter regulations but is also exploring opportunities to adapt a modified policy a solution could be to allow the use of bunker with a 0.5 sulphur level as studies show that the environmental impact of 0.5 vs 0.1 is insignificant nevertheless dfds is taking a pragmatic and innovative course and also exploring solutions using new technology dfds teamed up with specialist supplier alfa laval to trial new scrubber technology in and became the first company to fit a large sulphur scrubber in a ship scrubbers remove sulphur dioxide and particulate matter from ship exhaust gases the wash-water is discharged harmlessly under licence the project is led by our technical organisation with close involvement of the ship s crew and the danish epa the test project on ficaria seaways shows good results there are some limiting factors affecting how and where such scrubbers can be used these include scrubber size and weight installation complexity ship stability and age we are actively engaging with the eu on assistance to fund environmental investment the european maritime safety agency and other relevant authorities are involved in the testing and audit of the results of the equipment operators will not

supply chain connects many suppliers modes of transport and countries within it we strive to create and protect commercial value affected by issues relating to security product safety quality environmental protection and social responsibility dfds supply chain management scm teams aim to help minimize the risk and maximize the security of the supply network and reduce acquisition and administration costs through working together across the dfds group the scm function sits within the finance division of dfds scm comprises procurement demand and supply and special project functions its day-to-day work directly affects the profitability of dfds and suppliers it involves price negotiations contractual arrangements risk management working with business units inventory management and monitoring to ensure regulatory compliance we revise our supply chain policies and our ethical code for suppliers we assess our supply base for its costeffectiveness resilience safety and other risks on land and at sea dfds demands that suppliers operate in a decent and respectful manner in the shipping business for example our audit programme checks that a supplier is on the relevant maritime authority database as required under the eu marine equipment directive 1996 a supplier will achieve the wheelmark and be included in the database if it satisfies the criteria dfds follows the global ship management system approach to check that a supplier meets safety and environmental requirements that it has achieved its wheelmark since the dfds supplier code of conduct has been a part of all dfds purchasing and business agreements ultimately when a contract is signed with a supplier in our shipping and logistics businesses the dfds supplier code of conduct is attached to it this outlines dfds commitments to applying ethical principles in business and respecting human rights the dfds supplier code of conduct to do business with dfds a supplier must comply with all applicable international conventions and national legislation in the country where the work or service is being performed and specifically it must respect the following or involuntary labour workplace principles and rights at works on grounds of race religion age nationality sexual orientation or gender and anti-bribery including all subcontractors and business partners in the country where the product is manufactured or the service performed during the discussion on dfds strategic approach to cr and the identification of our key material issues responsible procurement is identified as having potential impact on brand reputation relationships and customer orders our supply chain teams work closely with suppliers on a day-to-day basis and suppliers feedback and innovations are valued by dfds progress in in the scm team numbered 17 people working out of denmark uk and lithuania in we established a new centralised scm operation and a new integrated purchasing system is under development whilst contracts are managed locally a corporate scm database will allow detailed corporate-level analysis of supplier profiles numbers issues feedback and benchmarks for example the database is due for

delivery our vendor managed inventory vmi pilot project intends to reduce costs improve service share risks and rewards exchange information openly and enhance transparency and trust it s a strategic alliance where the supplier makes re-fuelling decisions for the buyer as well as cost and sales benefits it will help improve punctuality and security of supply in we adopted a new ‚Äò efficient

75,DFDS,ANN,2012,"cr report cr report dfds and corporate responsibility cr social responsibility inspires to create value for our stakeholders and our company cr work begins to take shape the cr committee had its first full year of operations in the focus was mainly on the development and phasing in of a model for managing cr work including reconciling social responsibility and value creation in the business we have decided to decentralise the cr work as opposed to setting up a group function to integrate it in the daily life of the business areas our corporate responsibility cr reporting is still a work in progress but already now we experience that reporting requirements on measuring performance is inspiring development for example in terms of damage prevention in freight the cr perspective has served as a catalyst for more regular measurement and sharing of best practices across regions increasingly we also find that customers take dfds cr efforts into consideration in their decision-making processes for example one company wanted to hear about it prior to booking a major conference on one of our passenger ships partly for this reason we are in no doubt that integrating social responsibility into our activities will ultimately make dfds more competitive our reporting in does not include every item that could be categorised under the umbrella of cr however in the areas that dfds considers the most important e.g emissions and health and safety for passengers and staff our reporting is well advanced however we need to improve our ability to report on socially beneficial activities that concern hr our customers and suppliers one precondition for doing this is the introduction of better it systems for data acquisition our most important goal for is to continue the integration of cr work into the daily activities of the business areas by following this path we believe the greatest benefits can be achieved for all stakeholders niels smedegaard president ceo 42 dfds annual report our approach to corporate social responsibility dfds is responsible for a large number of employees and their working conditions and for health and safety at work we help keep northern europe s infrastructure and supply of goods running we are responsible for passenger safety for customers freight and for the environmentally sound operation of our business we are also responsible for creating a return on investment in dfds and much more this is reflected in a number of policies and standards in areas related to social responsibility in several areas specific targets have been set for cr work e.g reducing emissions and customersatisfaction targets will be introduced in in addition to policies dfds has introduced an ethical code of conduct which acts as a supplement to the standards of behaviour to which we aspire as defined in the dfds way see page 18-19 our cr strategy the cr strategy aims to create and protect value for stakeholders thereby underpinning dfds position as a preferred supplier and employer identifying stakeholders and understanding their needs and requirements are important priorities in the strategy the stakeholders and their expectations are listed on page 44-45 cr perspectives can be embedded in the organisation through internal initiatives and action plans but also through actively involving stakeholders in relevant working processes the strategy also requires a significant amount of communication with stakeholders and ongoing improvements to our cr reporting cr report managing the cr work the cr strategy and its overall goals and policies are set by the cr committee which refers to executive management the committee is composed of those responsible for cr work in the different business areas and group functions niels smedegaard ceo has overall responsibility for the committee the committee meets at least once every three months the intention is that external stakeholders will be invited to participate in at least two meetings per year twice a year the chair of the committee will report to group management and annually to the management board an important task for the committee is to promote the decentralisation of cr work to the business areas and group functions one group management meeting per year will focus on cr work company should sign up to for example the un global compact and whether the report should be audited by external parties dfds is still developing its processes for collating and quantifying cr data and envisages that the extent of reporting including external auditing will increase over the next few years working with stakeholders value creation via cr requires the involvement of stakeholders stakeholders are defined as any individual or organisation that dfds affects or that affects dfds this includes stakeholders without voices e.g the environment and future generations pages 43-44 list dfds stakeholders processes for dialogue and

to reflect the society in which we live and work as diversity among employees and managers is important to us we would like to see more women in senior management positions this fits well with a danish bill requiring the 1,100 biggest companies in the country including dfds to set targets for the number of women on their boards at present women only account for approximately 27 of the supervisory board our ambition is to increase this to at least 33 within the next four years and at least 40 by 2020 based on company policy dfds has drawn up an action plan containing specific short- and long-term initiatives each year we will report on our goals and progress in these areas new to dfds we have introduced a wide-ranging group induction policy to help new employees acclimatise to their workplace and to the corporate culture and working environment under this policy all managers will be given guidelines to ensure that new team members undergo a systematic induction that is consistent with our core values the dfds way and our performance-driven culture testing at dfds as part of dfds recruitment process tests are used as a dialogue tool but not as a method of examining applicants following the acquisition of norfolkline the need arose to adapt these tests so that they could be administered by a single provider during the summer of after assessing several providers we decided to use thomas international for future testing certification and implementation is taking place in the period q4 to q1 along with the decision about the new testing tool a general group

for these areas trainees a new training programme developed along with the danish shipowners association led to the recruitment of six international trainees in september they have commenced a two-year period of rigorous training in our business areas combined with theoretical study at college a further six will be recruited in this process has already begun continuing education in connection with the renewal of agreements in dfds and the shipowners reached agreement on a number of issues with the danish metalworkers union maritime section dmma it is now possible for seafaring employees who are members of the union to take training courses if they have no or few certified qualifications the parties have discussed how this should be financed and have agreed to apply to various funds for support in addition individual seafarers may enter into a training agreement with dfds which will then help fund their training by paying a lower wages during the training period agreements with dmma cover most employees in catering and about half of all other employees deck/engine apprenticeship scheme for ships under the uk flag due to the demographic profile of our maritime employees on vessels under the uk flag it is predicted that a large proportion of our able-bodied sailors will retire over the next 2‚Äì5 years we have therefore in collaboration with the merchant navy training board and the british chamber of shipping secured funds for an apprenticeship scheme for local youngsters in the dover area we have begun collaborating with local schools in order to attract suitable candidates apprenticeships are combined with seasonal positions as car-deck marshalls which means that candidates go to college for maritime training during the off-season and in the high season they return to the ships as car-deck marshalls and gain practical work experience at sea the programme was launched in november after 18/24 months the first local born and bred able-bodied seafarers will qualify just in time to take over when the first of the older generation retires socially relevant support relationships with local communities are mainly a local responsibility dfds

consumption b technical optimisation technical optimisation incorporates enavigation including it programmes that plan optimal sailings based on detailed information about ships and routes along with real-time information about currents water depth wave direction and height wind optimisation of the ship s trim etc it also includes the optimisation of engines switching to more energy-efficient propellers and rudders cleaning of hulls and reducing on-board energy consumption which includes hundreds of initiatives regarding pumps heating lighting etc c on-board behaviour via their behaviour individual employees and teams can make a significant impact on energy consumption a considerable shift in attitudes has already been noted and each and every individual now aims to help reduce energy consumption to support this dfds awards a quarterly bunker prize to the ship that is best at sharing experiences of the bunkeroptimisation initiatives implemented on board as all of the ships vote for the winner ideas are spread effectively everybody is kept up-to-date and as per the dfds way best practices in the environmental field emerge laws and regulations the maritime environment is covered by international and regional conventions and laws which are continuously adopted and implemented as far as dfds is concerned the most important ones are usually conventions and laws passed by the un s international maritime organization imo and by eu and national governments most of the rules that affect efforts to reduce pollution from ships are part of the marpol convention dfds annual report the marpol convention regulates the use of hazardous substances the processing and discharge into the marine environment of potentially environmentally harmful substances e.g sewage oily water and ballast water and emissions into the atmosphere of potentially environmentally harmful substances such as co2 nox and sulphur from ships engines the afs convention governs the use of antifouling paints on ships the routines and processes that ensure compliance with these rules are described and documented in the company s safetymanagement system international safety management ism which is maintained and updated by the marine standards department a complete updated version is available on all ships dfds and each of its ships are regularly audited both internally and by external authorities this ensures that the regulatory framework and the necessary routines are known and respected on land on land standard eu and national laws govern our work environmental work on land is initiated by health safety the environment a sub-section of the sustainability public affairs department in the people ships division local management also initiates activities for example activities on land must comply with legislation relating to climate change e.g carbon reduction commitment crc in the uk a government scheme designed to promote efficiency amongst medium and large energy consumers in ports and terminals every effort is made to improve energy efficiency in buildings plant and equipment cr report as part of our customer service dfds logistics units in belfast bruges ghent gothenburg and helsingborg are iso 14001 ems-certified environmental risks the main commercial risk factors are changes in environmental regulations and increases in energy prices the environmental policy contains guidelines for the analysis of costs associated with new regulations and their implementation as well as the potential costs of solutions legislation on sulphur content in bunkers a particular risk is the introduction in of imo rules about not using fuel with more than 0.1 sulphur content in a special control area comprising the baltic sea the north sea and the english channel this entails a risk that inflated prices for low-sulphur oil and generally higher costs for shipping could in some transport corridors lead to a greater proportion of freight customers opting for land-based transport solutions which would have unintended environmental effects on land dfds has adopted an innovative course to meet this challenge and is studying solutions using new technology in the company initiated collaboration with alfa laval and man diesel to test new scrubber technology on the freight vessel ficaria seaways making it a pioneer in the use of sulphur scrubbers on a ship s main engine the scrubber removes sulphur dioxide and particles from the exhaust fumes lloyds has been involved in the testing and auditing of the results for the device as well as the technical development of the marine scrubber system dfds has also been involved in developing the regulatory framework that underpins their use however despite the positive results on ficaria seaways a range of factors place limits on the use of scrubbers including their size and weight installation complexity and the stability and age of the vessel dialogue with the eu on funding for this kind of environmental investment will therefore continue alternative fuels are also being considered liquefied natural gas lng may be suitable in some new ships but the supply chain price and practical implementation require further study and development although the shipping industry is prepared to invest we and our competitors fear that switching to alternative solutions will not be feasible for ships within the deadline stipulated by the eu directive cleansing ballast water similarly new regulations for cleansing ballast water which are designed to counteract the spread of invasive species will also present a major challenge for shipping companies as they will need to invest in on-board waste-water treatment plants grater tank capacity etc design index for ships eedi under the auspices of the imo and the eu an energy efficiency design index eedi has been adopted which states that efficiency must be incorporated into ship design in order to reduce co2 emissions fleet fuel consumption 2007-2012 fuel consumption g/gt/nm an eedi has not yet been adopted for ro-ro and ro-pax ships as a calculation method that will be accurate and useful for these types of vessel has not yet been identified dfds is involved in the dialogue and work to find a fair and workable calculation that takes into account the special conditions that apply to these ships progress in co2 intensity fuel consumption bunker oil is the main source of co2 emissions from ships total consumption varies over time as the fleet changes in order to trace trends on a transparent and objective basis consumption is measured in grammes per gross ton gt per nautical mile g/gt/nm the target of reducing co2 emissions by 10 was achieved in however the fleet has undergone substantial changes in this period and bunker consumption has been systematically quantified and monitored with the acquisition of norfolkline dfds acquired a significant business area in the english channel which altered the ratio of ro-ro to ro-pax ships ro-pax ships especially those on short routes in the english channel are more fuel-intensive which affects the level of savings on energy consumption it is also significant that in the first five years dfds has reaped the benefits of a number of readily accessible opportunities to achieve savings in spite of all this we have now set ourselves the target of reducing fuel consumption per nautical mile per gt by an additional 5 by in the average consumption in g/ gt/nm for the whole fleet was 1.9 lower than in 7.0 as shown in the figure the changed profile of the fleet following the acquisition of norfolkline has had an impact on the overall trend for fuel consumption however for all types of ships the trend is for a steady reduction in consumption 6.5

the company s goal of cutting energy consumption and co2 emissions over the past year almost 90 of the bulbs in the passenger areas have been replaced with led bulbs a total of 2,346 bulbs have been changed resulting in a saving of 94,376 watts per hour for all three ships the big 800- and 400-watt floodlight bulbs on deck have been replaced with 86- or 56-watt led bulbs resulting in a saving of more than 29,754 watts per hour improvements in logistics activities on land port terminals and distribution hubs are becoming more energy efficient e.g through the establishment of an energy-management team emt in larkhall and belfast for example new more efficient cooling technology is expected to generate annual electricity savings of 30 increasingly environmentally efficient trailers and refrigerated vehicles are being used including in collaboration with customers e.g the supermarket chain asda in great britain which uses double-decker trailers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions per transported pallet dfds is also taking part in a public trial in great britain and northern ireland to test special long trailers that will reduce energy consumption per transported unit work is ongoing with suppliers on the use of more fuel-efficient trucks and we are continuously investing in upgrading the truck fleet to more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly euro 5 trucks in the proportion of euro 5 trucks in dfds 150-vehicle fleet reached 50 in peterborough the whole fleet has now been replaced with euro 5 trucks throughout the year a number of local initiatives were implemented to reduce the number of kilometres driven without a load which also helps to reduce energy consumption the main focus was on planning and the use of it tools gathering trailers and containers into larger pools is a particularly good way to plan this work more efficiently environmental collaborations and partnerships considerable environmental benefits can be achieved by devising joint solutions in collaboration with suppliers customers authorities and other partners ship energy efficiency management plan seemp on 1 january a new rule came into force all ships over 400 gt must have a ship energy efficiency management plan seemp this is an imo initiative aimed at improving the energy efficiency of ships dfds was well prepared to implement the plan since we had already made a well-documented and structured effort to plan and implement energy-efficiency initiatives including quantification and follow-up seemp can be integrated directly into the dfds maintenance system sertica which staff on the ships are trained to use 56 dfds annual report in in addition to the extensive cooperation with alfa laval man and the danish environmental authorities on the development of a sulphur scrubber discussed above dfds worked with several other partners on a range of environmental initiatives projects included high-efficiency water-cleansing system dfds has installed and tested a new system for cleaning oily bilge water on pearl seaways it is more efficient and reliable faster and cheaper to operate than existing ones and is also certified as per imo regulations the cleansing effect far exceeds the requirements for bilge cr report water which are currently max 15 parts per million ppm oil residue the new system produces bilge water with less than 5 ppm catalytic reactor on petunia seaways the manufacturer and supplier man has developed a new catalytic reactor that effectively purges ships smoke of nox a pilot model was built into the engine room and chimney system of petunia seaways in it is now being tested in regular daily operations in the north sea shore power in accordance with the rules and as part of the campaign air emissions in ports dfds has been using fuel oil with a sulphur content of less than 0.1 while in port since locally this has resulted in a 90 reduction of sulphur in air pollution in some ports nitrogen oxides nox are also removed using catalysts with the help of local measures dfds is also continuously striving to reduce noise from ships generators ventilation systems and port operations another effective tool for improving the environment in port areas is the establishment of shore-based electricity supplies which enable ships to be powered from the grid while in port dfds has entered into collaboration with the port of ghent volvo group and the eu which will support the project with eur 1m on shore power in the ports of ghent immingham and gothenburg as well as on the six ships calling at these ports dfds investment in the project is approximately dkk 50m the plants are expected to be ready to conduct shore-power tests by these particular ports and ships were chosen because they have the best conditions for setting up shore power i.e in terms of the ships length of stay in port the fact that the ships are expected to be deployed on these routes on a long-term basis and the nature of ports and ships dialogue with neighbours in our port terminals for example in rotterdam as well as on the ships e.g between oslo and copenhagen dfds enjoys and wishes to continue a positive dialogue with our neighbours regarding the inconvenience that shipping can cause what we can do to reduce it and how best to create understanding between the parties through meetings neighbourhood visits and other initiatives new sailing times save fuel on 2 april departure times for the two passenger ships on the copenhagen‚Äìoslo route were modified to reduce oil consumption the ships embark 15 minutes earlier and arrive 15 minutes later so spend an extra half hour at sea every day this cuts oil consumption by more than two tons per ship per day which corresponds to a reduction in co2 emissions of over 6.4 tons per ship per day waste processing and recycling of ships waste is produced by most activities on board ships and in logistics centres oil chemicals and water used for cleaning purposes must be processed in accordance with environmental legislation see the section on cleaning bilge water above on the passenger ships on the copenhagen-oslo route dfds in co-operation with an external company and in accordance with the rules in force in the two countries where the ships dock has developed a particularly efficient and environmentally friendly overall plan for the processing and disposal of waste from the ships operations including the kitchens passenger departments etc ships are scrapped in accordance with the imo

alignment of all activities and services with dfds standards conformity in marketing communication and an overall travel experience that meets high standards on all dfds routes customer surveys and customer service projects in dfds we have over the years developed a strong sense for our customer s expectations through ongoing and comprehensive customer satisfaction surveys css the surveys enable a deeper understanding of customer demands and a transformation of those findings into day-to-day operations and services on board the css provides the customers with the possibility to give individual feedback to dfds and thereby contribute to the continuous process of adapting the on board experience to passengers expectations to support our capability for continuous improvement two

consistently respects data privacy and complies with the european data protection directive 95/46/ec as well as with the national data protection acts in the countries we operate in in consequence marketing communication is only sent to individuals who have explicitly agreed to this dfds further follows the process of enacting the proposed european general data protection regulation to ensure compliance with new regulation passenger rights dfds follows the european maritime passenger rights regulation 1177/2010 that entered into force in december in accordance with the regulation dfds ensures that assistance is offered to disabled passengers and those with reduced mobility from the booking to port facilities and the voyage on board the dfds vessel passengers with special needs are supported and appropriately informed further topics of the regulation that dfds covers include transparency in pricing across countries and the entitlement of passengers to certain rights in the event of delay or cancellation communications with passengers dfds puts high emphasis on informing all passengers about the various important matters of their journey a lot of this communication takes place directly at the check-in and on board the ships however a significant and increasing proportion of information is given through different channels including the internet developments range from service calls prior to departure to increased social media presence that help to fulfill dfds responsibility of informing passengers on all matters of importance the approach to social media is

function is part of the finance division of dfds focus in the sourcing process is on selecting suppliers with the best fit for the needs and demands of dfds therefore any supplier selection process begins with analysis of our own needs demands and requirements through a close dialog with a broad spectrum of suppliers we assess the supply base for its cost-effectiveness resilience safety and compliance to regulatory requirements on land and at sea dfds demands that suppliers operate in a decent and respectful manner in the shipping business for example our audit programme checks that a supplier is on the relevant maritime authority database as required under the eu marine equipment directive 1996 a supplier will achieve the wheelmark and be included in the database if it satisfies the criteria dfds follows the global ship management system approach to check that a supplier meets safety and environmental requirements and that it has achieved its wheelmark since the dfds supplier code of conduct has been a part of all dfds purchasing and business agreements ultimately when a contract is signed with a supplier in our shipping or logistics businesses the dfds supplier code of conduct is attached to it this outlines dfds commitments to applying principles in business and respecting human rights moving ahead during the move towards an integrated purchasing system was put on

in new rules regulating the permitted level of sulphur in bunker fuel are set to increase fuel costs by 40-50 the new rules coming into force on 1 january represent a considerable challenge for dfds and the rest of the ferry industry in northern europe in line with our environmental policy we support initiatives to make our world greener as long as it happens in a sensible way and on a level playing field versus our competition including other transport modes from the outset we took on the responsibility of adapting our business to the new rules and contributing to making society greener we are however responsible for protecting the interests of all our stakeholders and have therefore worked actively to achieve some mitigation or financial support concerning the transition to the new rules so far without any success what is important now is that the rules are implemented as announced without any last minute concessions that would change the level playing field ferry operators like dfds and others who in good faith have made substantial in- vestments should be rewarded over the course of time for acting responsibly to contribute to a greener infrastructure experts to be the leading shipping company when it comes to applying the scrubber technology our strategy for overcoming the challenge of the new rules has three elements installation of scrubbers on up to 20 ships at a cost of dkk 750m preparing customers for the transition to a higher shipping cost and analysing requirements for consolidation of routes on another positive note we have expanded the section on community work in the report supporting local communities within our network is an important way for dfds to give back to society the activities also involve voluntary work by our employees for example when serving homeless people in oslo and copenhagen a christmas lunch on board our passenger ships for dfds and all other ferry operators the new rules will entail a substantial negative financial impact prices to customers will increase shifting some volumes from sea to land we foresee that several ferry routes in northern europe will close and jobs will be lost across the ferry industry another potential negative impact is increased road congestion the resulting economic impact is of course not a desirable scenario for our shareholders either to adapt and facilitate the transition to a greener infrastructure we successfully initiated testing of scrubber technology in and became a front-runner by successfully operating a scrubber onboard one of our ro-ro freight ships

vital part of europe s infrastructure as we operate the largest ferry route network in northern europe and provide transport and logistics solutions across europe we are responsible for passenger safety for customers freight and for the environmental impact of our activities we are also responsible for creating a return on shareholders investment in dfds and much more identifying stakeholders and understanding their needs and requirements are important priorities in the strategy stakeholders and their expectations are listed on pages 36‚Äì37 cr perspectives are embedded in the organisation through internal initiatives and action plans but also through actively involving stakeholders in relevant working processes we manage our corporate responsibilities through the implementation of policies and standards in several areas specific targets are set for cr actions for example reducing emissions and this year we are introducing customer satisfaction targets managing cr the cr strategy and overall goals and policies are set by the cr committee which reports to executive management the committee is composed of managers with direct responsibility for implementing cr in business areas and group functions niels smedegaard ceo has overall responsibility for the cr committee the strategy also involves communication of our goals and actions to stakeholders and ongoing improvements to our cr reporting enjoy the report niels smedegaard president ceo in addition to policies dfds lives by an ethical code of conduct which acts as a supplement to the standards of behaviour to which we aspire as defined in the dfds way our cr strategy our cr strategy aims to create and protect value for all stakeholders thereby underpinning dfds position as a preferred supplier

international regulations under the international safety management ism code the international ship and port facility security code isps and the maritime labor convention mlc all maritime safety measures and security factors must be reported for all ships on an ongoing basis and all ships must report any incidents on board this the ism code also requires a designated person ashore to ensure safe operations and a link between the shore-based management and the captain and crew on board safety and security audits are held on all ships in the fleet at least once a year findings are detailed analyzed measured and shared to promote best practice and continuously promote a strong safety culture on board in addition inspections are also carried out as a separate task during the year shipping incidents reported our approach part of dfds customer service is to ensure systematic implementation and monitoring of safety standards safety processess build on continuous improvement and sharing of

advanced first aid on all passenger and cargo ships extensive drills are conducted each week based on around 15 different scenarios such as marine evacuation as we have had three fires on board our ships in crew training is highly important to maintain a high safety vigilance important events in all ships are surveyed and certified according to international eu and national legislation including internal audits and inspections on safety and security according to statutory instruments and company procedures in april all former ld lines ships on french flag changed their safety management systems to the common platform of dfds during an interim implementation period all systems were implemented on board and dfds a/s was fully certified and granted a french document of compliance in december on 20 august the ilo maritime labour convention came into force in all ratifying countries dfds manages ships in several of these countries the new convention applies minimum standards on an international level in terms of crew welfare food and hygiene safety and safety related issues all ships in the dfds fleet flying flags of ratifying countries were certified in due course and well before 20 august for the rest of the fleet managed in countries that have not ratified the mlc convention no exceptions are made and they comply to identical principles as the ships of the ratifying countries in april a fire broke out in a car transporter on the car deck onboard victoria seaways the fire was caused by an electrical malfunction in a second-hand car onboard the car transporter the fire was quickly extinguished by the ship s drencher system and no injuries were incurred in november a fire broke out in cargo on the weather deck on board britannia seaways the fire was caused by leaking aviation fuel ignited by sparks from shifting cargo due to extreme weather conditions with significant wave height above 10 metres the fire was brought under control and eventually extinguished by the ship s crew during 10 hours of fire fighting no injuries were sustained tragically an accident on board patria seaways in november cost the life of one of our crew members the accident occurred during repair works in an elevator shaft and dfds immediately informed all ships about the accident and preliminary precautions to avoid similar accidents in the future the precautions will be evaluated as soon as the authorities have completed their report about the accident and the cause of it has been established psychological assistance was provided for the ship s crew following the accident dfds has provided the bereaved family with necessary assistance years based on our continuous focus to improve in december a fire broke out in a car transporter on the car

in was the development of an overall safety culture within the workforce to grow the concept of personal responsibility for safety safety culture development is complementary to the overall culture of the dfds way which among other things promotes continuous improvement and sharing of best practices increased awareness has led to changes 6 21-30 safety performance data is collated into a monthly report made available to management the reporting system has been developed to seek increased causal understanding by the identification of ‚Äò unsafe acts and ‚Äò unsafe conditions data on non-injury ‚Äò accident potential near-misses and hazard observations is part of this development the modified reporting system will begin from january 11-20 reporting the network of ‚Äò data responders covering 55 operational sites continued to develop in with the addition of a port terminal in gothenburg and additional channel ports newhaven portsmouth le havre and dieppe the safety performance of newcomers to the dfds group is monitored but only included in group safety performance statistics at the start of each full reporting year thus safety performance for a swedish transport company karlshamn

and slip/trip these two causes combined account for 45 of all injury accidents injuries caused by both manual handling and slip/trip and hand-tool usage and tug driving are largely due to human factors individual mistakes and errors by individuals who have a large element of personal responsibility for safety thus whilst improved performance shows that safety culture has improved this has to be continued in to reduce the number of injury accidents i.e a general improvement of personal safety attitudes and behaviours rather than improvement to the ‚Äò hardware of existing safety management systems/practices being required this will be addressed in by the continued provision of specialist safety training and increased auditing safety training in a ‚Äò safety workshop was held early in

benefit and organisational efficiency in this manner hr contributes to the continued growth and development of dfds diversity in february we announced our policy for diversity inclusion our value proposition is our target for female representation on our board of directors excluding employee elected members is a minimum of 33 which is achieved with current composition we are planning to further increase the number of women in senior management positions during the next couple of years as a direct continuation of our diversity inclusion policy we employed a hr intern to analyze gender diversity in dfds the project consisted of data collection in-depth interviews with both women and men in dfds as well as focus group sessions all aimed at gaining a better understanding of what drives our female employees in dfds project objectives were to address the issue of a relatively small number of females in dfds management group to present an overview of the current status of gender diversity among dfds the data show that women form a total of 28 of dfds workforce but only form 10 of all employees on higher management levels executive vice president vice president and director level some of the findings from the project are that when we employ directly into a management position it is more likely to be a male than a female male employees with shorter seniority are more likely to reach higher management levels than female employees the number of male employees with long seniority 15 years is much higher than female employees in we will act on the findings to move closer to our goal of employing a diverse workforce employee engagement survey in november we launched our employee engagement survey bearing with access for all dfds employees to participate bearing is important to analyse where we are doing well and where we can improve in order to continuously improve as an organization the response rate was 76 which was a slight increase from distribution of

‚Äò women in dfds and to suggest how dfds should work with gender diversity in the future in order to reach our goals on diversity hr in dfds dfds results and our employees competences and commitment are tightly connected we can not have one without the other our employees are therefore the essence of the dfds way it is vital for dfds continued development to be a preferred employer that attracts and retains employees in all kind of jobs in all the countries where we have activities we will lead an international and competent workforce that consistently understands our customers needs a

over 200 sales managers new analysis of diversity uk ireland holland belgium land sweden norway sea on an overall level the survey showed that dfds is a good place to work this is reflected by a score of 5.3 out of 7 for staff satisfaction and motivation although slightly lower than in naturally we would always like to register increasing satisfaction but scores are impacted by the level of challenges in a given period the recession in europe in and was challenging for dfds and many operational adjust- denmark ments have been made in this period in this perspective a score above five is acceptable our primary concerns are directed at the few areas scoring below five these are the areas where improvement is required and the report is useful in pinpointing where our resources should be spent cr report dfds annual report 12 talent and capability development during the year our employees continued to perform at a high level we are committed to helping our people perform at their best and achieve their full potential through ongoing training and development people review and agree on development objectives during their annual appraisal with their manager we continue to develop and strengthen our internal training programmes such as zoom leadership programme and focus specialist programme continued growth of our leadership pipeline and focus on succession planning are important for dfds future development hence one of our priorities for is to design and implement an internal programme for our high potentials the participants for this programme are talented employees with a potential to grow eventually into senior management positions as a natural derivation of this we aim to conduct a more structured approach to succession planning in dfds an identification process of the development needs of successors will be established in h1 based on the analysis of required needs a structure of relevant career paths and development initiatives will be determined and designed to ensure relevant development for the level of vice presidents and above a process of developing a programme will begin in the programme will be launched during h2 in addition an important area of focus is to meet and comply with internationally recognised human rights a policy to support dfds commitment not to violate such rights is under preparation we have implemented the dfds way of selling during this requires further training and coaching throughout and will primarily be done at local destinations including both sales representatives and managers furthermore centralized training will be offered twice a year february and october to new employees in with one exception no fines lawsuits or breaches of rules were registered in the hr area in we hired the second batch of shipping logistics trainees we now have 11 trainees in our pool who all are located in dfds businesses across the group we will continue to hire young trainees into the company dfds is now also approved as a place of education for danish waiters and makers of danish open sandwiches employment policies and employee relations our employment policies are developed to reflect local legal cultural and employment requirements we aim to be recognized as an employer of choice and therefore seek to maintain high standards and good employee relations wherever we operate local communities our uk apprentice scheme seafarers has turned out to be an extremely positive project as apart from generating a high level of interest in the local community it received national news coverage of the shipping community the scheme is seen by industry experts as ‚Äò setting the standards in seafarer training and making a real attempt to regenerate the british merchant navy out of the six original candidates four are on track to complete their edh efficient deck hand tickets in january further to this a major ‚Äò side benefit is an improvement in morale and increased engagement and commitment from our existing workforce on board as they recognise the apprenticeship scheme as a firm example of dfds walking the walk when we talk about our commitment to both the british flag and british seafarers it has considerably enhanced dfds profile in the local community leading to a substantial increase in the number of applications for our seasonal catering crew for as many people had read in the newspaper that dfds is a good place to work and it doesn t stop here in january the scheme will be expanded to include engine rating apprentices and at the end of another two-year programme for an

immediate cash support and leave to go home and help their families in total the lauritzen foundation annually donates around dkk 25m employee welfare in partnership with a danish union we have established a joint foundation to provide financial support to employees enabling them to work part-time if they are unable to work full-time for health reasons dfds also actively participated in the ensuing public debate about the danish welfare system that this socially innovative agreement prompted in order to share our experiences with society and promote social responsibility through collaboration between private companies and unions a seat on the danish government s advisory committee for corporate social responsibility where we can share our experiences and contribute to developing social initiatives job creation for young criminals dfds is engaged in a special project that aims to employ young people with criminal records in normal jobs we co-operate with the high five project which organises these partnerships and at any given time we employ about 10 young people on our ships and in our main office through this co-operation the aim is to help these young people back to a normal life and there has been a very high success rate of about 80 for those employed by dfds as our shipping operations constitute a working environment that fits well with the high

emissions a responsible recycling policy and in partnership with stakeholders contributing to effective and considered development of environmental regulations highlights on track to reduce bunker consumption by 5 in strategy and plans for transition to fuel with lower sulphur content in are in place consolidated measurement of nonship related co2 emissions initiated n  on-ship related co2 emissions amount to less than 10 of total emissions our approach dfds environmental work is governed by our environmental policies which have been drawn up by the company s management and approved by the board of directors the framework for environmental work and reporting is driven and managed by dfds cr committee which is chaired by the company s director of environment sustainability day-to-day environmental initiatives are primarily driven by the technical organisation and by the environment sustainability department both departments are part of the people ships organisation the work is also driven by local initiatives and individual departments and employees according to the dfds way s goals of continuous improvement and sharing of ‚Äò best practices dfds environmental report covers initiatives both at sea and on shore at sea the work to reduce fuel consumption and therefore co2 emissions at sea consists of three main focus areas a the interface between ship and shore this involves sailing plans arrival and departure times coordination between ship and shore on arrival and departure load planning and stevedoring etc the aim is to ensure that the ship spends as little time as possible in port with a view to spending as much time as possible at sea so that speed can be lowered and fuel consumption reduced b technical optimisation technical optimisation covers e-navigation including it programmes which plan optimal sailings on the basis of detailed information about the ship and route plus continuous information about current water depth wave direction and height wind optimisation of the ship s trim etc it also includes the optimisation of engines use of more energy-optimised propellers and rudders cleaning the bottoms of ships and saving energy consumption on board this covers hundreds of initiatives for pumps heating lighting etc c behaviour on board individual employees and teams can significantly influence energy consumption through their behaviour on board there has already been a significant change in attitude resulting in every individual having a target of contributing to a reduction in energy consumption to a greater degree laws and regulations shipping s environmental work is controlled by international national and regional conventions and environmental legislation which are continuously being approved and implemented for shipping for dfds this particularly involves conventions and legislation introduced by the united nations international maritime organization the eu and governments of individual countries the majority of the regulations which are of significance for shipping s efforts to limit pollution from ships are part of the so-called marpol convention the marpol convention regulates the use of environmentally hazardous substances the handling and discharge into the marine environment of potentially environmentally damaging substances for example ordinary waste water water containing oil or ballast water plus emission of potentially environmentally damaging substances such as co2 nox and sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere from ships engines ashore legislation regulating land-based activities is mainly national parts of which are derived from eu directives furthermore the so-called afs convention controls the use of anti-fouling bottom paints on ships ashore we are obliged to comply with legislation regarding climate change for example carbon reduction commitment crc in the united kingdom a government scheme to improve the energy efficiency of medium-sized and large energy consumers we work in a targeted manner to improve the energy efficiency of buildings facilities and equipment in ports and terminals the routines and processes required in order to comply with these regulations are described and documented in the company s ism international safety management safety control system a complete updated edition of which is available on all ships and which is maintained and updated by the marine standards department the company and the individual ships are continuously audited both by the authorities and internally in order to ensure that the regulations and necessary routines are known and complied with environmental efforts ashore are partly initiated by a department for environment sustainability in the people ships division there are also initiatives implemented by local management as part of our customer service the logistics activities in ghent gothenburg belfast and hamburg are iso 14001 and/or iso 9001 certified dfds seaways plc is iso 9001 certified environmental risks the most important commercial risk factors are changes to environmental cr report dfds annual report 15 regulations and rises in energy prices the environmental policy includes guidelines for analysing the costs linked to new regulations and their implementation plus the costs of any solutions legislation on the sulphur content of bunkers the introduction in of imo and eu rules limiting acceptable fuels to those containing 0.1 sulphur within the specific control area of the baltic sea north sea and the english channel represents a special risk place limits on the use of scrubbers including the size and weight of the scrubbers the complexity of the installation and the effect on stability such installations may have and age of the ship there is ongoing dialogue with the eu regarding financial support for these substantial environmental investments alternative fuels are also being considered liquid natural gas lng may be suitable for certain new ships but the supply chain price and practical implementation require further investigation and development dfds is following an innovative course to meet this challenge and will install a number of scrubbers on up to 20 ships the expected investment is approximately dkk 750m in the period 2013‚Äì2017 the scrubber removes sulphur dioxide and to some extent particulate matters from ships exhaust gases in the course of the summer of scrubbers were installed on three freight ships and scrubber installation is planned for a further seven ships during work is being done in parallel to these initiatives at both national and international level to clarify the outstanding points in legislation regarding the certification and use of scrubbers requirement for cleaning of ballast water in december the imo approved new regulations for the cleaning of ballast water to safeguard against the spread of invasive species via ballast water the convention is expected to be ratified in the course of after which the rules will come into force 12 months later we therefore expect these to come into force in the autumn of like the new sulphur regulations the ballast water convention will involve significantly increased expenditure for shipping including for dfds over the next few years despite the good results on ficaria seaways where the first scrubber was installed in a range of factors the final rules on ballast water management are likely to include some exemption options to what extent dfds tonnage can qualify for exemptions is uncertain and a worst case scenario thus includes installing ballast water management systems on the entire fleet average fuel consumption of the dfds fleet fuel consumption g/gt/nm co2 rules regarding obligatory reporting on co2 emissions for ships the so-called mrv regulation measuring reporting and verificating are being drawn up under the auspices of the eu even though discussions about which ships will be subject to the rules are continuing we expect all dfds ships to be covered by this reporting requriement from 2018 dfds actively participates in various working groups covering the final wording of the rules and reporting formats 5.6 6.2 6.0 5.8 5.4 5.2 5.0 jan dec fleet bunker consumption is the new baseline year for dfds targeted reduction of bunker consumption by 5 over the next five years 2013-2017 average consumption increased in by 0.4 due to the addition of ships from ld lines in q4 adjusted for these ships the fleet s average consumption was reduced by 1.9 in compared to average bunker consumption g/gt/nm change vs 5.38 5.40 0.4 progress in co2 intensity measuring a company s total co2 emissions is a difficult process not least for a company as complex as dfds we have begun exploring a suitable system which is capable of measuring co2 from activities as diverse as ships port terminals warehouses cargo carrying equipment and offices bunkers the total absolute consumption changes over time in line with changes in the fleet in order to be able to monitor the trend on a transparent and objective basis consumption is therefore measured in grams per gross ton gt per nautical mile g/gt/nm the main source of dfds co2 emissions is the ships consumption of fuel in the dfds group s total co2 emissions were approximately 1.9 mil- lion tons of which approximately 92 came from the ships the total figure for including non-ship emissions is not yet compiled on 1 october france introduced a legal requirement to state co2 emissions when selling transport services dfds has of course implemented systems so that these requirements are cr report dfds annual report 16 fulfilled both for our shipping and our logistics activities it is however a concern that national authorities introduce their own regulations in this area when work is being done on corresponding regulations at eu level for example the mrv regulations mentioned previously the mrv regulation will determine the measuring and reporting methods for all shipping activities in the eu and is expected to be approved so that 2018 becomes the first reporting year in the spring of crown seaways became the first ship in the dfds fleet to be issued with the international energy efficiency certificate by dnv target for reduction in co2 emissions dfds target of reducing the ships co2 emissions in the period 2007‚Äì2012 by 10 was achieved in a new target of a further 5 reduction for the period 2013‚Äì2017 has now been set in this context it is a paradox that the measures which are required to comply with the forthcoming sox emissions requirements will have a direct negative effect on a ships s co2 footprint emissions in we have made progress on setting a specific target for co2 emissions from activities other than ships this work is expected to be completed in environmental improvements to ships activities in average bunkers consumption in g/gt/nm was 1.9 lower than in adjusted for the addition of ships from ld lines in q4 2012. completed so the entire fleet of own trucks now conforms to the euro 5 standard in the course of the year a number of electric-powered vans have been acquired for local transport in denmark in addition at immingham the following measures have been adopted in the port of gothenburg approved ships equipped with scrubbers to be treated equally to ships fuelled by mgo alone this implies that ships installed with scrubbers are now also entitled to environmental discounts on port fees four of dfds ships which already have scrubbers installed will therefore benefit from this in invested in telematic systems for monitoring fuel consumption on the managed truck fleet reduced the top speed to 85 km per hour for trucks use of telematic system information to decide which lorries are best at specific operations many initiatives have been implemented or extended in the course of including these initiatives are expected to collectively reduce diesel consumption by approximately 5 installing energy-optimised propellers and rudders on a range of ships frequency control and optimising ventilation on ships energy-saving lighting our fleet of trailers is also being upgraded continuously the fleet of uk-based extra-long environmentally friendly trial trailers is being increased and similarly 100 extra huckepack trailers have been acquired which are particularly suitable for combined road and rail transport improvements to activities ashore ashore port and terminal facilities and distribution hubs are also being made more energy-efficient

consumption is a key area for our terminals and warehouses and significant measures have also been implemented here in new low-energy lighting at our warehouses in immingham is estimated to save 200 tons of co2 per year improved refrigeration systems and low-energy lighting at our warehouses in belfast and larkhall have reduced consumption by approximately 10 a multi-year contract for the supply of green electricity has been entered into for the terminal in vlaardingen land power the project mentioned in the report to develop land power in the ports of ghent immingham and gothenburg and on the six ships which dock at these ports has been discontinued this is due partly to greatly increased costs and partly to a lack of commitment by the other external partners involved dfds is however continuously investigating similar projects it must be noted here that several countries are working on legislation which may make cheaper power possible for precisely such purposes waste processing waste is produced by most activities on board ships in logistics centres in ports and by our offices we are developing particularly effective and environmentally friendly plans for the processing and removal of waste in partnership with an external company and in accordance with the regulations which apply in the countries in which we operate a total of nine locations and ships were covered by this plan in the course of and the work to extend the system will continue in the years to come in the locations and ships covered by this programme the share of recycled materials rose from 22 in to 47 in scrapping ships as the imo s draft hong kong convention from on the environmentally friendly scrapping of ships has still not been ratified in dfds has adopted its own set of rules which resemble the proposed text of the hong kong convention on all significant points dfds will comply with these rules for the scrapping of ships until the imo s convention has been adopted dfds had no

sea continuous improvement and focus on safety training and drills highlights no fatalities recorded in two boiler fires on ships ship collision with a quay training and drills save lives the dfds way is to enhance performance through continuous improvements and we believe that the major tools in achieving continuous improvements in our health and safety standards are training and drills on board our ships we believe that the training standards and frequent drills were instrumental in the crew s ability to fight a major fire in on our freight ship britannia seaways they also prevented minor boiler fires on calais seaways and dieppe seaways in from developing into major incidents dfds vice president of marine standards addressed an imo meeting in september he emphasised that more focus should be on training and drills involving the crew rather than the growing administrative burden experienced on board the issue was supported by the imo and by captain andreas kristensen of britannia seaways when he addressed the imo in november he had accepted with thanks the imo award for exceptional bravery at sea given to him and his crew for their brave handling of the fire on board in in line with our strategy dfds aims to participate in drills in cooperation with various rescue and emergency authorities a full-scale drill in included king seaways in a drill involving the british dutch and french authorities at the same time the cooperation with the rescue authorities included drills that simulated terrorist attacks on ships we welcome this cooperation and believe that these drills are extremely valuable when it comes to improving the safety and security of our passengers and crews lost time injuries frequency shows unsatisfactory regional variations the lost time injury lti frequency rate provides an overview of the number of work-related injuries in the past year dfds measures the lti frequency rate in work-related incidents per million working hours that cause absence from work for more than 24 hours no major injuries were recorded in however the frequency of ltis increased from 6.84 in to 9.31 in the increase is mainly due to a poor performance on our frenchflagged ships where back pains and minor cuts are the major reasons it should be taken into consideration that dfds operates a number of passenger ships with a large number of non-ma- shipping incidents reported near-miss reports average per ship lost time injury frequency ltif fatalities 62.3 9.3 0 64.5 7.0 1 38.5 3.3 0 31.7 2.9 0 13.4 6.6 0 data excludes the subsidiaries ab dfds seaways lithuania and dfds logistics as norway rine staff catering where we see very minor cuts to hands causing a high lti frequency for hygiene reasons because the affected people work with food this accounts for a major difference in the average lti frequency between passenger ships 10.29 and cargo ships 4.30 however the lti frequency in our french fleet is unacceptable and will be addressed in in order to reduce lti frequency on board our ships dfds has started working with the danish seahealth occupational health service s√∏fartens arbejdsmilj√∏r√•d its experts come on board our ships to assess and document the risks and train the crew in safe routines and strategies to limit the risks actions are not taken dfds policy is to support the reporting of near-miss incidents in order to develop best practices in avoiding and reacting efficiently to near misses in 62.3 near misses were reported on average per ship this is a satisfactory level and in line with the average number of reports in and well above our target future steps commitments 2015/16 reduce the number of crew accidents on board french-flagged ships maintain progress towards zero lost time accidents across the rest of the fleet continue improvement in safetyrelated performance near-miss reports near misses are hazardous occurrences that under different circumstances could lead to an incident if corrective safety and security at sea dfds cr report 6 our approach all ships are surveyed and certified according to international eu and national legislation they are also subject to internal audits and inspections for safety labour conditions and security according to statutory instruments and company procedures under the international safety management ism code the international ship and port facility security code isps and the maritime labour convention mlc all maritime safety measures and security factors must be reported for all ships on an ongoing basis and all ships must report any incidents on board this can be done anonymously under a ‚Äò no blame policy according to company procedures and international safety guidelines our marine standards experts people ships vps and ceo meet monthly to review formally the ships safety-related performance core to this process is a review of all safety and operational data collected from ships in readiness for inspection by maritime authorities such reviews are published to all ships and key shore-based managers dfds health safety and environment policy which is reviewed annually by management is designed to deliver improvement through active demonstration of commitment and leadership this means practising what we preach with all managers behaving in a way that demonstrates safety and accountability safety culture development is complementary to the overall culture of the dfds way which among other things promotes continuous improvement and sharing of best practices richard baines dfds group hse manager safety and security at sea dfds cr report 7 safety and security ashore highlights no fatalities recorded in accident frequency has decreased accident severity has increased most accidents caused by individual s actions rather than failure of systems e-learning tool enhances safety training and raises awareness of safety risks lower accident frequency but more severe injuries dfds is an organisation in continuous growth and this also applies to the land-based activities port terminals warehouses offices and transport operations therefore we have decided to measure our land-based safety performance by means of an accident frequency rate afr rather than the number of accidents in this way we will get a true picture of the safety performance that reflects the actual risk to individual employees and can be compared from year to year in dfds recorded an afr of 6.22 this is a 12 improvement compared to however we did not reach our 15 improvement target that would have been an afr of 5.80 or 42 lost time accidents ltas with 3,572 land-based employees in injury severity represented by lost working days significantly increased in compared to the average number of lost days per lta more than doubled from 12 in to 26 in dfds group safety performance jan-dec. group ltas afr 39 6.86 48 7.10 45 6.22 enhanced safety training the accidents are by and large caused by individuals actions rather than there being a failure of safety management systems this is a continuing trend from therefore the solution is to increase individuals personal awareness of safety as part of the overall development of dfds safety culture in order to raise awareness and knowledge about safety among staff dfds has introduced e-learning safety modules so people can receive online safety training this has greatly improved the number of people who have received safety training in 2,320 e-learning safety modules were completed there is a suite of six core safety modules with common applicability across the group risk assessment fire manual handling slip/trip display screen equipment and environment plus several site specific modules such as food safety for belfast and each module takes approximately 30 minutes to complete a module is only counted as complete when an 80 pass mark is achieved future steps/commitments e-learning tools will continue to contribute to improved safety by raising awareness of safety throughout the organisation dutch language versions of the core safety modules have been prepared to make the material more user-friendly french language modules will be generated in our approach safety management is operated by the local management teams to maintain flexibility and proportionality of response based on risk thus more safety controls and formalised inspection regimes are operated for higher risk activities port terminals than lower risk activities offices the national and international safety legislation applicable across the dfds group has a common basis in eu legislation this allows for an internal safety management standard for the dfds group based on a uk model of safety management reporting the reporting system is both simple so as to not overburden small low-risk units and yet sophisticated enough to allow the reporting of injury accident detail allowing generation of causal analysis the network of ‚Äò data responders covers 55 operational sites causal analysis is used to inform managers of trends and to feed into managers ‚Äò safety action plans to ensure the proactive management of safety safety performance data is collated into a monthly report made available to management the reporting system has been developed to seek increased causal understanding the target for will be a 15 improvement

dfds cr report 11 in january the scheme was expanded to include engine rating apprentices and at the end of another two-year programme for an additional six deck apprentices was initiated the result of these initiatives is that for every person retiring over the coming years a newly qualified able bodied seafarer deck or engine hand will be waiting in the wings having gained any one of our ratings apprentices can if they have the right competence and aptitude become a captain or chief engineer within a space of 15 years this is made possible through the long-standing rating to in our

replacement vessel was chartered for deployment in early spring mainly in copenhagen harwich and le havre dfds offered the affected staff members an outplacement programme to help with job applications some major changes have affected staff ashore during such as the establishment of a new finance service centre in poland and recruitment of 150 staff for the centre however it has also meant that an equal number of jobs were lost in other countries in and furthermore efficiency projects and route closures also affected staff future steps/commitments alignment of hr processes across

life and take an active interest in community issues including job creation and support of community initiatives helping young people escape crime in denmark dfds is cooperating closely with the high five project which is a community project to find jobs in private companies for young people with a criminal record the aim is to offer a way back to a crime-free life via a normal job in dfds employed ten young former criminals mainly on our ships on the oslo-copenhagen route on board a ship the working environment is dedicated and supportive and about 80 of the participants in the programme leave crime behind permanently some of the initiatives taken by dfds in were employee welfare in partnership with the danish union dmma we have established a joint foundation to provide

and other stakeholders the picture is from the award ceremony on board crown seaways dfds community involvement dfds cr report 14 environment laws and regulations at sea much of our environmental efforts are aimed at complying with regulations and conventions issued by a number of regulators the most important are the united nations international maritime organization imo the european union and the relevant national governments dfds received global environmental recognition in dfds received lloyd s list global award and the environmental performance award at the annual marine propulsion auxiliary machinery awards for our scrubber investment at the ship technology conference in norway dfds was voted green shipowner of the year therefore dfds believes that currently the scrubber solution is the best alternative when it comes to the environment dfds is investing dkk 750m in refitting ships with scrubbers in scrubbers were installed on seven ships this increased the number of dfds ships operating with a scrubber to 11 and makes dfds leading in scrubber re-fitting globally a further six scrubber installations are planned for and other means of reducing sulphur dioxide pollution and complying with the new regulations such as using lng are being considered for the future in emissions of sulphur dioxide from dfds fleet and estimated for 10,000 8,000 6,000 4,000 2,000 dfds installed scrubbers on seven ships in this means that currently 11 ships operate with a scrubber a further six scrubber installations are planned for 2015. general we believe the lng solution is more efficient for new ships in dfds was granted up to eur 6.2m from eu primarily for scrubber refitting dfds on track with target for reduction of co2 emissions in we continued and increased our efforts to reduce co2 emissions more than 95 of dfds emissions stem from bunker consumption on our ships and focus has therefore been on this area with an extensive bunker reduction programme in the centre of our efforts however in steps were taken for a structured programme to also reduce our shore-based energy consumption and emissions at sea dfds is on track to reach our target of further reducing energy consumption at sea by 5 from to the most efficient ways of reducing bunker consumption on board are lower speed at sea and consolidation of volumes on bigger ships however many smaller initiatives together also produce substantial fuel savings 0 new sulphur rules and scrubbers sulphur emissions from ships was the main environmental challenge for dfds in from 1 january new sulphur rules in the baltic sea the north sea and the english channel prohibit use of bunker oil that contains more than 0.1 sulphur up until use of bunker oil with 1.0 sulphur was allowed the overall aim of the rules is to reduce the sulphur dioxide pollution from ships in these densely populated regions therefore other means that can produce the same result are also allowed as an alternative to using low sulphur oil and since dfds has already successfully tested a scrubber that efficiently removes sulphur dioxide from ships exhaust gases the scrubber solution can be a financially better solution for some ships compared to using the more expensive low sulphur fuel and it has some additional environmental benefits it reduces the emission of particles from the exhaust gas by about 80 estimated in the major environmental initiatives were preparing for the new sulphur rules that came into force on 1 january as well as continuing the work to reduce co2 emissions reducing our impact on the environment our main means of reducing our ships bunker consumption and emissions are improvements in our ship-shore cooperation behaviours on board and technical solutions environment dfds cr report 15 our business activities have an impact on the environment and therefore we are constantly searching for innovative and intelligent ways to develop dfds in a greener direction it is our policy to consider the environmental impact of everything we do niels smedegaard main means for reducing fuel consumption on board ship-shore cooperation slow sailing is essential when it comes to reducing fuel consumption on board through structured efforts we aim at finding more time for reducing speed at sea without delays for our customers therefore shoreship cooperation that can reduce the time in port is extremely important this includes improvement of sailing plans coordination between ship and shore on arrival and departure load planning and stevedoring technical optimisation dfds continuously evaluates and invests in new energy saving technical solutions this includes e-navigation including it programmes which plan optimal sailings based on very detailed and continuously updated information about the ship route weather and other sailing conditions optimisation of engines use of more energy-optimised propellers and rudders hundreds of other technical improvements on each ship ranging from improved pumps heating lighting to ventilation and galley equipment improved behaviour on board individual employees and teams can significantly influence energy consumption through their behaviour on board therefore dfds is continuously communicating individual as well as group efforts in order to share best practices among ships and other involved persons monitoring dfds continuously monitors fuel consumption for all ships in gram per nautical mile per gross tonnes in order to have comparable monitoring basis for all ships co2 regulations to comply with dfds considers it to be a problem that varying legislative bodies like single nations the eu and the un imo introduce legislation in the same area to the benefit of international trade dfds supports uniform international regulations instead of separate national legislation in dfds total fuel consumption at sea was 487,000 tonnes environment dfds cr report 16 other initiatives to enhance dfds environmental performance at sea include our waste handling programme initiatives to reduce noise and a number of programmes aimed at reducing the domestic energy consumption through improved lightning ventilation and automation reducing energy consumption and emission ashore ashore at port terminals and in our warehousing and road transport activities we strive to reduce energy consumption through the establishment of energy management teams the work involves a number of initiatives such as replacing trucks with more fuel efficient ones and larger units plus more efficient planning and monitoring tools to reduce empty driving the enhanced use of telematics and improved driving skills are also key contributors to our environmental programme that comply with the reporting formats dictated by these organisations work that is not yet completed for our activities in the eu the energy efficiency directive will entail we perform the required independently audited energy surveys the first of which is due by the end of in addition to the initiatives required by legislation dfds is also working on other initiatives that goes beyond these standards co 2 emission for dfds fleet g/gt/nm 19.5 19 18.5 18 17.5 17 16.5 16 15.5 15 future environmental initiatives there are several environmental initiatives in the pipeline that will affect dfds in the short to medium term the ballast water convention is close to being ratified this will result in having to equip the dfds fleet to comply with these regulations the eu and imo programs on co2 the so-called mrv measuring recording and verification will initially involve setting up systems environment dfds cr report 17 freight customers greater focus on customers in highlights customer satisfaction a high strategic priority group-wide customer focus initiative and dfds way of selling continue dfds again voted ‚Äò world s leading ferry operator our approach dfds aim is to be recognised as the preferred supplier in its dealings with customers to continuously achieve this goal our actions are guided by the five principles of dfds guiding star for customer focus these five principles are enshrined in the daily working life of all dfds offices and set measureable targets to deliver superior reliability and schedules constantly bring new solutions to customers be easy to work with deliver customer service by empowered people with cando attitudes ensure we provide fast communication when it matters increasing customer satisfaction in dfds continued to focus keenly on customer service by means of the customer focus initiative cfi certificates at various stages and is designed to enhance long-term development in the relationship between the customer and dfds a successful tool has been the many local staff and customer townhall meetings held at dfds locations throughout our network during the year at those meetings customer companies are invited to join dfds staff meetings to present their companies their products developments and needs as well as the challenges they face the close customer contact has also led to many enhancements such as improved communication via sms email or telephone with our customers if there are delays or disruption to services following the major cfi customer surveys in previous years and to understand our customers needs and challenges further as well as their experience of dfds customer service we also conduct shorter customer surveys via email based on the findings we continued to develop the dfds way of selling which is a specially developed dfds sales and service training programme the aim is to help our sales force gain a deep understanding of the needs and challenges of our customers businesses and create solutions to address these needs this process calls for collective interaction with the customer and investing time to agree and construct proposals that add value to their business in order to develop the service quality of our sales force the programme awards a useful tool for mobile booking has been developed for some ferry routes information about services or the national regulations affecting drivers in the shape of folders in various languages as well as other solutions that support our customers in their business in our logistics business it has led to the development of tracking tools so our customers in some areas can track their shipments on-line delivering sustainable solutions transport is a critical part of the supply chain and a critical part of our customers environmental performance the environmental performance of our transport services is a vital element in our customers ability to serve their end customers in a resource- and cost-¬≠ effective manner therefore we see it as our responsibility to develop solutions that will help our customers minimise the effect their business has on the environment as can be seen in the chapter about our environmental performance in dfds is in the process of refitting a major part of the fleet with scrubbers which can remove sulphur from the exhaust gas in order to comply with a new set of sulphur regulations the scrubbers also bring about a reduction in the emission of particles making it a sounder environmental solution than using low-sulphur oil our ability to measure and report on our usage of fuel and to have proactive targets to reduce our co2 emissions is an increasingly important element of customer service dfds now offers customers a tool to measure co2 usage on many routes and also a comparison with other transport modes customers can now measure the benefit of switching shipping routes or switching from road to rail and can actively track the benefits over the year in we continued our extensive fuel reduction programme for our ships as reported under the section on environment it also included the opportunity to use our intermodal solutions on longer transports including rail which reduces the carbon footprint dramatically furthermore dfds has invested in more modern trucks and trailers to reduce the fuel consumption per unit transported thus benefiting our customers environmental performance this freight customers dfds cr report 18 included the use of larger units such as 15.65-metre trailers in the uk double deck trailers and super cube trailers the additional capacity can reduce road journeys and hence contribute to less road congestion and fewer co2 emissions it also gives our customers a significant cost saving in their distribution costs in line with the dfds way of operating we are continuously improving our daily operations of our logistics services through better planning tools and pooling of equipment in order to increase services and reduce empty driving this reduces costs and our contribution to congestion on the roads as well emissions dfds code of conduct dfds has developed a code of conduct which is available from dfds website it is among other

86,FirstFarms,ANN,2007,"corporate social responsibility firstfarms focuses on sustainable development and assumes corporate social responsibility csr in connection with its acquisition of companies in central and eastern european countries and in particular in connection with the subsequent operation of the farms firstfarms policy is for the subsidiaries to comply with all environmental and animal welfare requirements in regard to production and operation as well as other requirements such as the various working-environment and training requirements in force in the country where the respective farms are placed as a rule such compliance is not in place when existing companies and farms are taken over consequently firstfarms is preparing the necessary action and investment plans to ensure compliance with applicable legislation to ensure sustainable development in regard to issues such as the environment and animal welfare and to ensure employee satisfaction and training firstfarms uses many resources on corporate social responsibility csr since the company considers that this approach will work to the company s benefit in the longer run environment firstfarms does not wish harm to nature or the environment to result from the company s activities in central and eastern europe that is why the company wishes to ensure compliance with environmental rules as farm activities are pursued in the different countries where the company runs farms in compliance with legislation in the countries where first- farms operates the company monitors the use of pesticides and fertilisers pesticides which are not approved in the country in which the company carries out agricultural activities are not used by the company the company complies with legislation in respect of the quantities and use of both organic and non-organic fertilisers in some areas special environmental agreements must be observed in these areas which are cultivated under eu environmental consideration rules the rules are monitored in regard to field plans crop rotation and spraying restrictions in those areas of slovakia which are subject to special environmental protection in proximity to the morova river flood plains the company abides by the particular environmental regulations applicable here in this area approval of the spraying plan is also obtained from the environmental authorities before spraying commences the company wishes to avoid its employees being involved in environmental accidents so the company ensures that the employees have the requisite statutory training in how to use the different sprays such training is provided on an ongoing basis and is refreshed at least once a year upon the company s initiative firstfarms acquired the slovak agricultural company mlyn lahore a/s in october a company with over 2,000 hectares of leased land about half of this land is certified for organic production which means that first- farms is able to offer organic farm produce for sale animal welfare firstfarms wishes to improve efficiency and operate profitable farms but not at the expense of animal welfare that is why the company seeks to ensure that the animals do not suffer any distress or injury from the activities pursued by the company in central and eastern europe to avoid animal abuse and negligence during transport of the company s animals buyers and carriers of firstfarms animals have documented that they are in compliance with applicable animal transport legislation firstfarms thus ensures its compliance with all applicable animal transport legislation in the countries where the company operates in the eu the regulation of animal transport is specified in exactly the same manner in all member states in the form of council regulation ec no 1/2005 of 22 december 2004 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations firstfarms complies with local country rules in regard to medication and retention deadlines consequently the only medicine stocks kept are known about by the authorities and inspected on a regular basis the company collaborates closely with the veterinary authorities in the countries where the company operates firstfarms is also engaged in providing supplementary training to local vets with the assistance of their danish counterparts this ensures optimal treatment based on the latest methods which far exceed normal practice in central and eastern european countries firstfarms seeks to avoid supplying milk with medication residue to the dairies and thus to the consumers this is done by milking cows that have received medical treatment separately so that this milk is not accidentally mixed with the milk supplied to the dairies the milk from cows that have received medication treatment is not used as fodder for heifer calves either since firstfarms does not want to run the risk of having multi-resistant animals in the herd in addition to retraining of local veterinarians the company also assists with education and retraining of hoof trimmers in order to ensure proper treatment of hooves and to avoid leg injuries this means that the highest possible regard is paid to animal welfare at

20 from 35,207 m3 in 2008/09 to 28,562 m3 the heating consumption was 35,587 m3 the goal was not reached because more tenants than expected moved into gabriel business park during the year environmental report 8 environmental report of management continued consumption was also negatively affected by a very long and cold winter which increased the need for heating reduction of electricity consumption equivalent to 100,000 kwh the basis is last year s consumption of approximately 660,000 kwh excluding production energy consumption was 405,800 kwh and the goal was thus reached inter alia by using energy-saving it equipment reduction of paper consumption by 20 from approx 7,000 kg to 5,600 kg consumption was 2,235 kg and the goal was thus reached the reduction was achieved mainly by discontinuing a number of standard printouts of computerised lists and instead extracting data which the user can see on the screen farveriet scandye litauen at the end of the financial year gabriel s employees made up 55 of the total number of users of the property the consumption of electricity heating and water concerning gabriel s activities is therefore considerably lower than the figures stated determining principles and methods which can relate these environmental impacts to the individual tenants is part of the environmental action programme for 2010/11 measurable improvement goals at the dye works scandye reduction of current water consumption by at least 7 from 204 litres/kg to 190 litres/kg water consumption was 171 litres/kg and the goal was thus

direct and indirect environmental impacts energy consumption and energy production quantities of waste water and their content of substances with an environmental impact chemicals and dyes the total quantity of waste information in safety datasheets statutory limit values requirements under the eu flower eco-label requirements under the oeko-tex health label new information from institutes authorities and others with extensive expertise in the area of the environment gabriel has notified the city of aalborg of the contamination and investigations have been started to establish the extent of the contamination for the purpose of removing it or taking other measures the environmental data are given on page 15 assessment of indirect environmental impacts indirect environmental impacts at subcontractors premises are determined on the basis of the same criteria of significance which apply to gabriel s activities in aalborg environmental matters are evaluated in visits to subcontractors and gabriel requires its suppliers to comply with all local statutory requirements subcontractors are also evaluated in relation to gabriel s environmental requirements and action plans are reviewed with suppliers to ensure that their environmental impacts are constantly being reduced the importance of environmental impacts is expressed by setting up key figures which show the impact relative to production the environmental audits made at selected subcontractors premises include mapping of environmental parameters and environmental management and an assessment of compliance with iso 14001 requirements the goal is to minimise the relative environmental impact the criteria for labelling with the eu flower are also used assessment of environmental impacts at the aalborg site significant indirect environmental impacts at subcontractors premises include energy consumption and waste water in scouring and dyeing consumption of chemicals energy consumption raw materials waste from production waste water transport of raw materials and finished goods the requirements regarding noise specified by the city of aalborg were complied with the terms are given in notes on page 17

completely outsourced to the dye works scandye which meant significant environmental indicators and impacts from scandye the relative environmental impacts in particular are relevant in relation to gabriel s production because total consumption also includes production for customers other than gabriel historical consumptions of the most important raw materials have been provided for the last five years as this consumption is not affected by the place of production consumption of district heating was primarily waste heat from production of electricity a varying part of the electricity consumption was renewable energy from wind turbines and hydroelectric power the danish energy agency s standard factors of 17 january for calorific value and co2 emissions were used concerning natural gas emissions waste water key indicators gabriel s environmental data include key indicators the figure a in accordance with emas iii such as energy efficiency material efficiency water waste and emissions which express the total annual input/impacts in the various areas the figure b which expresses total output and the figure r which expresses the ratio a/b which is also indicated under environmental data waste water emissions equal the purchased quantity of public potable water consumption of raw materials the stated consumption of raw materials includes waste during production which was approx 5 the consumption of raw materials includes gabriel s total consumption waste energy a cooling of 35 degrees c was used for conversion of m3 of district heating to kwh calculation factors provided by energicenter aalborg were used for calculation of co2 and so2 emissions because of uncertainty with respect to emissions in lithuania concerning electricity danish key figures were

financial year gabriel s employees made up 55 of the total number of users of the property the consumption of electricity heating and water concerning gabriel s activities is therefore considerably lower than the figures stated in this report determining principles and methods which can relate these environmental impacts more accurately to the individual tenants is therefore part of the environmental action programme for 2011/12 gabriel continues to receive new tenants and gabriel employees now make up less than 40 in addition gabriel s employees and the tenants share communal facilities to a great extent the emas report will therefore continue to provide information on the total impacts from the entire business park although the individual tenants are responsible for their own environmental impacts in consultation with the tenants measuring has been established of particularly large impacts and of installations structured in a way enabling direct allocation of the consumption to the rooms used by the tenant examining the possibilities of updating and reusing samples which have been sent out on the market there was no interest in this solution and we will therefore concentrate our efforts on ensuring that sample material is targeted at the right target audiences and on making other marketing material available on our website and in other media rather than as hard copies gabriel s employees and tenants share communal facilities to a large extent 13 environmental report 2010/11 criteria for determination of significant environmental impacts following gabriel s environmental policy significant environmental impacts are determined on the basis of inter alia the following criteria for direct and indirect environmental impacts energy consumption and energy production quantities of waste water and their content of substances with an environmental impact chemicals and dyes the total quantity of waste information on safety data sheets statutory limit values requirements under the eu flower ecolabel requirements under the oeko-tex health label requirements to environmental cradle to cradle certification new information from institutes authorities and others with extensive expertise in the area of the environment the importance of environmental impacts is expressed by setting up key figures which show the impact relative to production the goal is to minimise the relative environmental impact assessment of environmental impacts at the aalborg site the total energy consumption was at the same level as last year with an 11 reduction in district heating consumption and a 7 increase in electricity consumption the increase in electricity consumption was due to an increased number of workplaces in the business park oil contamination at an old oil tank was found in november when carrying out earthworks the oil tank was last used in 1998 when it was emptied and cleaned gabriel immediately informed the city of aalborg of the contamination and an investigation was subsequently carried out to establish the extent of the contamination the case is now closed and the soil around the tank has been sent away for treatment in addition the tank has been filled with sand and the required registrations have been made with the city of aalborg the requirements regarding noise specified by the city of aalborg were complied with the terms are given in notes on page 19 the environmental data are given on page 18 assessment of indirect environmental impacts indirect environmental impacts at subcontractors premises are determined on the basis of the same criteria of significance which apply to gabriel s activities in aalborg environmental matters are evaluated in visits to subcontractors and gabriel requires its producers to comply with all local statutory requirements subcontractors are also evaluated in relation to gabriel s environmental requirements and action plans are carried out together with subcontractors to ensure that their environmental impacts are constantly being reduced the environmental audits made at selected subcontractors premises include mapping of environmental parameters and environmental management and an assessment of compliance with iso 14001 requirements the criteria for labelling with the eu ecolabel are also used significant indirect environmental impacts at subcontractors premises include energy consumption and waste water in scouring and dyeing chemicals consumption energy consumption raw materials primarily new zealand wool waste from production waste water transport of raw materials and finished goods consumption of raw materials is primarily new zealand wool and polyester for production of furniture fabrics gabriel uses new zealand wool the environmental performance of gabriel s products ensures that there is no impact on the environment from either processing or many years of use by the consumer the products can be handled after their useful lives as ordinary non-hazardous waste or recycled as they contain no hazardous substances such as heavy metals gabriel makes audits and other follow-ups on suppliers to identify the indirect environmental impacts we have for example carried out a follow-up on the dye works scandye and gabriel china carries out similar follow-ups on chinese partners 14 environmental report 2010/11 the

data from 2008/09 and earlier environmental data are no longer affected by production in aalborg these historical data were therefore not included but they can be found in previous reports in may production was completely outsourced to the dye works scandye which meant significant environmental indicators and impacts from scandye the relative environmental impacts in particular are relevant in relation to gabriel s production because total consumption also includes production for customers other than gabriel historical consumptions of the most important raw materials have been provided for the last five years as this consumption is not affected by the place of production key indicators gabriel s environmental data include key indicators the letter a in accordance with emas iii such as energy efficiency material efficiency water waste and emissions which express the total annual input/impacts in the various areas the letter b which expresses total output and the letter r which expresses the ratio a/b which is also indicated under environmental data energy a cooling of 35 degrees c was used for conversion of m3of district heating to kwh calculation factors provided by

will be made to provide lithuanian data in future reports emissions of nox and ch4 methane were not included as the quantity emitted is considered insignificant consumption of district heating was primarily waste heat from production of electricity a varying part of the electricity consumption was renewable energy from wind turbines and hydroelectric power the danish energy agency s standard

the spread of c2c includes provision of consultancy services by qep master which together with the consultancy firm milestone pro has most recently advised the company ke fibertec in gaining c2c certification this is opening the doors to new partnership possibilities our csr work makes a positive contribution to all areas of our business and among our partners we do not believe that it can pay to compromise with for example the environment or animal welfare as all these areas have a positive influence on the company s value creation while adding value to the products for our customers and users a shortage of raw materials with a concomitant risk of major increases in raw material prices is a very substantial challenge for all communities and the individual company gabriel has studied how we can use recycled materials materials for recycling are gathered and partnerships have been established with two independent companies which can take polyester waste we want to exercise effective control over the resource cycles and a detailed knowledge of the recycled materials composition is required in order to ensure that the new goods which have been produced possess the required quality and environmental properties the object of this report is to share information on gabriel s work in the areas of csr and the environment with our customers employees suppliers the authorities shareholders the local community and others with an interest in gabriel s csr and environmental performance we want to share this knowledge openly and honestly and we want to commit ourselves to regular improvements by announcing where we re heading we monitor our environmental performance via specific kpis and follow up on them the 2011/12 financial year provided us with a

increasingly strict market demands for products which take due account of resource use health and environmental impact c2c is also becoming an area of focus for the forthcoming periods where the goal includes launching of a number of c2c products made of polyester good csr and environmental results were obtained in 2011/12 at gabriel s dye-works scandye water consumption per kilogram of textile was reduced by over 10 as dyeing is performed with machines with the lowest water consumption and regular investments are made in technology which requires fewer resources energy and gas consumption per kilogram of textile did however increase slightly as other major customers of scandye had lower production quantities than in the previous year which has a negative effect on the key figure scandye was audited under sa8000 social accountability and the csr certificate has just been issued consumption of heat in gabriel business park aalborg was reduced significantly via optimisation of

fashion csr is central to the way we run gabriel as a company and is a permanent point on the strategic agenda csr at gabriel is no mere fashion phenomenon but a strategic driver on a par with product development sales and other activities gabriel s continuous work with csr ensures that ‚àô‚àô we deliver healthy quality products ‚àô‚àô we make products with maximum consideration for the environment and resource consumption ‚àô‚àô we ensure a healthy working environment everywhere we produce and with our customers ‚àô‚àô we can document the relationship between words and actions at a minimum we meet the requirements under the un global compact our csr activities make a positive contribution to all areas in our company because this creates healthy and valuable business ethics which are visible at all levels in the supply chain we do not believe that it can pay to compromise on for example working conditions the environment or animal welfare because all these areas have an influence on the company s health and they provide the necessary security for our customers explains ceo anders hedegaard petersen there s a person behind the process here at gabriel we put a fingerprint on society all the way from raw materials to the finished upholstered product and we therefore share responsibility at all stages both locally and globally our approach to textile production therefore always has csr and value adding in mind for example we re strongly focused on animal welfare for the 100,000 sheep which supply wool for gabriel s textiles we ensure that our dye works in lithuania operates with safe technology and environmentally correct machinery we require our chinese suppliers to comply with western csr standards and that there is no corruption child labour or violation of human rights at any point throughout the process we may never lose consciousness of the person behind the processes in the supply chain we must always assume responsibility here and ensure orderly conditions we therefore also make heavy demands on our partners and advisers says business manager for qep quality environment and production kurt nedergaard exceptional value for customers and users our continuous serious work with csr ensures that we as a company can vouch for the conditions under which our products are made for our customers our work ensures that their furniture products are easier to document and attract no negative attention with respect to csr we work globally with customers who specify the most stringent requirements with respect to documentation for our products this also applies to social impacts and we believe that our csr activities provide exceptional assurance and therewith also value here csr and environmental report 14 the textile s life cycle processes activities and products our goal and our policies set the framework for gabriel s work in the value chain including how we work together with selected partners to solve the tasks gabriel has an impact on the entire route from raw materials to the finished upholstered product and we therefore have a shared responsibility in all stages both locally and globally our approach to textile production and the value chain therefore always has csr and value creation in mind to achieve the greatest possible environmental effect for the initiatives we take we work from the perspective of the textiles complete life cycle this helps us to ensure that we don t optimise a step in the life cycle without noting how it affects the environmental qualities of the following steps we also ensure that the initiative is focused on where the environmental effect will be greatest the textiles life cycle can generally be described under the model on the next page environmental matters in the textile s life cycle are determined on the basis of systematic readings including of input raw materials water chemicals and energy and measurements of output waste water scrap and emissions we also regularly analyse and report the findings of institutes authorities and others who are thoroughly familiar with environmental matters in order to identify relevant concerns the importance of environmental matters is reflected in our setting up of key figures for the individual matter and its effect relative to the completed production the goal is thus to minimise the relative environmental impact the mapping shows that the following can be regarded as the most important environmental matters in the textile s life cycle ‚àô‚àô raw materials new zealand wool ‚àô‚àô raw materials polyester fibres ‚àô‚àô energy consumption and waste water especially in washing dyeing and finishing treatment ‚àô‚àô consumption of chemicals ‚àô‚àô energy consumption ‚àô‚àô scrap from production ‚àô‚àô waste water ‚àô‚àô transport of raw materials and finished goods ‚àô‚àô disposal including recycling of the products these matters relate primarily to suppliers and customers activities indirect environmental impacts given that gabriel s environmental work is product-oriented we do however also seek to work to a high degree with these matters in cooperation with suppliers and customers it is therefore essential that we have a good relationship with for example our suppliers so that we can advise them of our requirements and goals matters related to gabriel s activities in denmark direct environmental impacts are ‚àô‚àô consumption of energy and heating ‚àô‚àô noise ‚àô‚àô generation of waste ‚àô‚àô transport for customer visits supplier follow-up etc high priority areas this report describes both how we handle the direct matters and how we operate in the textile s life cycle with respect to the indirect matters our initiatives are described under six main areas which help us to implement our goals and policies for csr and the environment these six prioritised areas were chosen under the following criteria ‚àô‚àô matters prioritised by gabriel s csr and environmental policies ‚àô‚àô matters judged important by legislation ‚àô‚àô matters judged important in product labelling including c2c oeko-tex and the eu ecolabel ‚àô‚àô matters where gabriel has an influence on effecting an improvement ‚àô‚àô the relative importance of environmental matters the six main areas are ‚àô‚àô materials and resources ‚àô‚àô responsible production and management of suppliers ‚àô‚àô environmental labelling and certifications ‚àô‚àô development and innovation ‚àô‚àô social responsibility and the working environment ‚àô‚àô gabriel business park these areas are discussed in greater depth on the following pages where we provide an overview of our attitude activities performed results and new goals as a whole this should also be considered our environmental

long-term partnership with wools of new zealand wools of new zealand is your guarantee of high quality raw material and good conditions for the sheep wool is a naturally produced renewable resource so we avoid drawing on limited raw materials wool is therefore also an obvious choice in relation to gabriel s cradle to cradle activities wool is very durable and it maintains its attractive appearance in use assuring the finished product a long service life wool also possesses unique dyeing properties where the dye is absorbed into the fibre and the material absorbs light meaning very attractive colours with lots of depth and no reflections finally wool is non-allergenic gabriel uses only high quality raw wool thus avoiding many chemical finishing treatments polyester has come to comprise a significant part of gabriel s product range in recent years polyester is the world s most used fibre and it has properties which make it suitable for production of furniture fabric polyester is particularly suitable for recycling as with wool we only work together with suppliers which can supply high quality polyester yarns enabling us to ensure that our quality requirements can be met cycles our range of textiles includes the product comfort which consists of 37 recycled pet and we re continually working to discover the possibilities for increasing the proportion of textiles based on recycled material chemicals are required in for example dyeing and washing processes and gabriel controls the choice and use of dyes and chemicals in our suppliers production we thus do not accept the use of for example ‚àô‚àô chlorine compounds ‚àô‚àô organic solvents ‚àô‚àô dyes containing heavy metals ‚àô‚àô dyes and pigments which can cleave off carcinogens ‚àô‚àô pvc ‚àô‚àô bromine-containing flame retardants ‚àô‚àô silver ions or other bactericidal treatments ‚àô‚àô anti-moth impregnation the substances in question are toxic ‚àô‚àô other substances classified as carcinogenic or mutagenic the environmentally friendly properties in gabriel s products ensure minimisation of environmental impacts during processing and the many years of use by the consumer after use the textiles can be handled as ordinary non-toxic waste or recycled into new products we re not merely focused on where the raw materials come from but also on what will become of the resources in their next life we are thus increasingly working on closing the material processing of tops csr and environmental report materials and resources goals and results goal 2011/12 collection of at least 3.0 tons of waste polyester materials including investigation of options for collection of waste from customers cutting out of furniture fabrics and reuse of this material running trial productions where waste is used in new polyester yarns including discovery of effects on quality and the environment in use of recycled material result 2011/12 a partnership was established with two independent companies which can take in polyester waste with a view to recycling it for new products a binding agreement is made with a recipient of polyester waste where the specific quantities and use of the waste product are agreed about 6.2 tons of polyester material are available for trials from our own production the upholstery supplier and another partner a continuous logistics system is established to handle the waste material a production test was initiated with collected polyester production waste in cooperation with partners who will determine what the material can be recycled into at least one new product is launched on the basis of recycled polyester fibre the introductory analysis of materials was performed it showed that if other substances are added to the polyester it can be weakened and made difficult to recycle to the same quality performing test productions with ¬≠recycling of the new product zenxit goals 2012/13 intensive work has been done on the product s properties but the project has not yet reached the stage where attempted recycling has been performed however the assessment is still that this is possible on the basis of the product s composition and the partner s experiences an introductory test of the viscosity of recycled material was carried out whether our own waste product can be used as a resource for new textiles is clarified the quality and environmental requirements for the material are established including its purity so that it can be used as a resource for new yarn specification of the product s ¬≠environmental and quality properties is continuing perform tests to determine the quantities in which recycled and new materials can be mixed 17 new zealand wool new zealand sheep production is recognised throughout the world for their high quality the sheep graze on open land and there are high standards for animal welfare and nature management gabriel has a long-term partnership with wools of new zealand which supplies the wool for our products wools of new zealand works with selected farmers and is thus our guarantee of a high standard wool is a renewable resource which is biodegradable or reusable in other products it also has natural fire-retardant properties and it does not catch fire on contact with a flame or hot embers wool has good properties in relation to the indoor climate for example air quality and humidity where the wool can absorb 35 of its own weight in moisture and still feel dry new zealand wool is also known for its high quality meaning for example that it is dirt-repellent and it maintains its good appearance because it naturally retains its shape from plastic bottle to comfort+ comfort+ is the market s top microfibre it doesn t pill and it retains both colour and appearance year after year it is also very easy to clean and maintain as it is waterand oil-repellent and spots are removed easily and without problems comfort+ consists of 37 recycled fibres deriving from pet bottles the fibres are high quality and their purity is monitored the fact that it includes recycled material does not have any effect on its ability to meet the quality requirements comfort+ has a most unusually long life we give a ten-year guarantee against pilling and perforation through wear the product has a wearability of 150,000 martindale which is very high comfort+ is oeko-tex 100 certified no organic

the supplier chain and we work actively to select and improve the best possible partners when we visit our suppliers an environmental assessment is a highly prioritised area and gabriel s requirements include compliance by the manufacturers with all local official requirements the suppliers are also assessed in relation to gabriel s own environmental requirements and together with the suppliers action plans can be implemented to ensure that environmental impacts are regularly reduced our partners are expected to work in accordance with our code of conduct which they must also sign our code of conduct is a set of rules which serve to provide guidance with respect to business ethics and to help our employees to maintain ethical behaviour this helps us to act in the best possible manner in our value chains the code of conduct was developed on the basis of the un global compact and is in accordance with the recommendations of the sector organisation dansk fashion textile conducting environmental audits at selected suppliers enables us to analyse environmental matters and environmental management which are evaluated in relation to compliance with the requirements of iso 14001 code of conduct requirements and criteria for labelling with oeko-tex or environmental labelling with the eu ecolabel are also used to assess performance these schemes also place direct requirements on the suppliers and compliance is verified by a third party following up on gabriel s partners in europe is undertaken by the team from aalborg while gabriel asia pacific undertakes equivalent following up on the partners in their region there is a close partnership with our dye works scandye where we regularly follow up on environmental projects and improvements gabriel a/s owns 49 of the share capital in scandye uab and the environmental impacts from the processes in the dye works also comprise a significant proportion of the environmental impacts attributable to the textile during its life the activities at scandye are therefore in focus in the overview of goals and results below scandye s environmental results in the 2011/12 financial year were affected by a single major customer s apart from gabriel s reduced purchases of piecework dyeing during the year focus in the 2012/13 financial year will be on energy consumption and projects on insulation of valves and heat recovery from the production equipment are planned gabriel is a member of the sector organisation dansk fashion textile s csr committee for the promotion of csr in the sector further details are

is closely integrated with gabriel s total quality and environmental management system maintaining exactly the same quality standards whether the products are made in europe or china csr and environmental report 25 environmental labelling and certifications gabriel uses generally accepted and internationally recognised product labels and certifications on the production side we have decided to focus on the eu ecolabel oeko-tex cradle to cradle and the nordic swan and we have frequently been at the forefront within the industry in using new labels in 2002 gabriel was the first upholstery fabric manufacturer in the world to use the eu ecolabel on a large part of the range and in gabriel was the first danish company to gain cradle to cradle certification our requirement is that an environmentally labelled product must be able to comply with all the customer s needs at the same level as or better than a product without the label gabriel does not have a specific green product line all products comply with stringent requirements which reflect the requirements under the oeko-tex scheme or the eu ecolabel we have also included a certification under the cradle to cradle scheme in selected areas and we expect this area to be extended in the future the product labelling helps to ensure that there is an objective basis for proving that what we say about our products is true the labelling schemes mean that our product range is subject to a number of different external tests and approvals which are our customers guarantee of the products performance this applies to both internationally recognised product standards such as those concerning wearability and fire-retardant qualities and environmental matters as already noted gabriel is also certified under iso 9001 iso 14001 and emas we have gained these certifications to ensure that we can systematically manage all parameters in our products production and that we can constantly improve our performance a large quantity of environmental and quality data on our products is available and we can thus offer specific details if a customer wants a particular label on his product for a specific market we regularly identify and prioritise whether we should include new product labels in our portfolio as this can be a route into new markets environmental labels and certifications goals and results goals 2011/12 all new products must carry either the eu ecolabel or oeko-tex results 2011/12 two products gained certification under the eu ecolabel goals 2012/13 all new products must carry either the eu ecolabel or oeko-tex one product gained certification under the swan scheme fifteen products gained certification under oeko-tex the product range is revised and updated to meet new requirements under the eu ecolabel which are expected to be adopted in march extension of the c2c programme to include at least one new polyester product csr and environmental report ds/16/20 eu ecolabel the eu ecolabel the flower is the european union s environment label the label covers environmental issues throughout the product s life cycle with focus on energy water and chemicals and accords a high priority to reducing the most significant environmental impacts of a given product for textiles this means focusing on the quantity of pesticide residues in the raw material the scouring of the raw wool the use and emissions of hazardous chemicals in production and the quantity of toxic substances and heavy metals in the finished product the eu ecolabel also sets requirements concerning the product s quality so that the product with the environmental label is at least as good as the non-labelled alternative www.ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/ oeko-tex oeko-tex is the world s leading health label for textiles the label certifies that the item was tested and approved on the basis of the requirements set by the international oeko-tex¬Æ association these requirements concern the content of chemicals which can or are suspected of being able to damage the body the label goes further than the law and the requirements are divided into four classes depending on the textile s use how close to the body they are the substances in question include for example formaldehyde chemical residues with an acidic or basic action pesticides phenols heavy metals special dyes and phthalates www.oeko-tex.com cradle to cradle cradle to cradle c2c concerns the way we view our resources extraction use disposal and works to create a closed cycle with either technical or biological nutrients the concept was formulated by the german michael braungart and the american william mcdonough in 2002 but ideas underlying the concept are now shared in a number of circles a c2c certification assesses the product in relation to five categories renewable energy water consumption the materials health properties social responsibility and recycling the result is certification at one of five levels the scheme is administered by the cradle to cradle products innovation institute www.epea.com www.c2ccertified.org www.mbdc.com management systems iso 9001 iso 14001 and emas iso 9001 and iso 14001 are both standards for quality and environmental management under which a company can choose certification both standards are based on the principle of making continuous improvements which are created by implementing a fixed cycle the current situation is evaluated goals are set and policies formulated the required actions are implemented and finally the result is measured on the basis of the result an assessment is made of whether actions and goal are adequate or whether improvements should be made and new goals set iso 9001 focuses on parameters of significance for a company s performance with respect to quality while iso 14001 concerns the matters of significance for the company s environmental performance an important tool in this is the audit which is an assessment of whether the systems are functioning as planned emas the eu eco-management and audit scheme has many parallels with iso 14001 as all the latter s requirements are included in emas in some areas the scheme is however more ambitious for example a published environmental account and measurable environmental improvements year by year are required www.iso.org

furniture fabrics in the price list under normal office or home use normal maintenance and appropriate upholstering the label was designed by gabriel gabriel also has a comprehensive spot removal guide which can also be used to keep the fabric clean and attractive in the event of an accident gabriel no heavy metals the label was developed by gabriel back in the 1980s to signal to customers that gabriel can offer ranges of dyes which are free of heavy metals gabriel was the first danish textile manufacturer to introduce this and no heavy metals are now used in our dyes since then the environmental labels have appeared and they also govern the limit values for heavy metals the label is also still used as a symbol of our tradition of taking the lead in the sector 26 a csr and environmental report 27 development and innovation innovation and value-creating partnerships are the foundation of gabriel s mission and this is also reflected in the way we work with our environmental impacts we want to be our customers preferred development partner so that the customer facing a new challenge sees it as entirely natural to turn to gabriel for advice we re in a position to solve environmental challenges throughout the product s life cycle and we re happy to share this knowledge with our customers we also want to inspire our customers to take new pathways in their work on environmental issues to discover new possibilities and thereby to offer customers new solutions which can benefit their business our policies are determined on the basis that we want to be leaders in the area we go further than the limits required by law this also protects our products against more stringent requirements under the law because we re already at the forefront when new requirements are made mandatory for all there is a close working relationship between the masters in gabriel on development of new products gabriel s qep master quality environment and production is involved at an early stage in the course of development ensuring that requirements and new possibilities are elucidated and integrated into the product development processes in recent years gabriel qep master has also used its expertise with respect to external partners who are not involved in our traditional value chains this helps to develop the work on quality and the environment for these partners while also extending qep master s area of business development and innovation goals and results goals 2011/12 results 2011/12 goals 2012/13 offer environmental consultancy to external

world s first c2c ventilation duct in cradlevent it generated considerable enthusiasm at gabriel which acted as a sparring partner during the certification process our goal in the partnership was not only that ke fibertec could go through the certification period quickly and comfortably but also that our experiences in the c2c area would benefit others for responsibility for the environment should be collective so we share our knowledge with other companies which are seeking the same values with c2c certification at silver level for the cradlevent ventilation duct the textile duct manufacturer ke fibertec has gained a unique position on the ventilation market no other manufacturer can supply a ventilation duct that complies with the strict documentation requirements under the certification for ke fibertec the c2c certification is both an ethical and a financial step towards a sustainable future as a company we want to take greater responsibility with respect to the environment and to develop sustainable products with a place on the market of the future there is no doubt that the need for c2c products is increasing energy requirements within construction are becoming more stringent and a scarcity of raw materials with consequent price increases is already a critical factor in the sector so it is entirely natural for us to recycle materials rather than producing new ones says claus albertsen ke fibertec s marketing manager we know the way at cradlevent s tender start ke fibertec approached gabriel and milestone pro with a view to a partnership on providing a consultancy service on the c2c certification process in we were the first company in denmark to gain c2c certification for our gaja textile and we then decided that our knowledge and experience should be shared with other companies which were also striving for the highest environmental certifications our knowledge must not be restricted to our own products on the contrary we want to contribute to other parties environmental work for when it comes to the environment we all have a common goal to create a greener future explains kurt nedergaard business manager gabriel qep so we re now offering a consultancy service on c2c certification and the companies which choose gabriel as their partner avoid the long road to certification on their own for we ve already been there the partnership makes the difference a mere nine months later ke fibertec had c2c certification for cradlevent the expectations are high for this is a ground-breaking product which will raise the standard throughout the ventilation sector the partnership with gabriel was a decisive factor in the product s development a choice which claus albertsen has not regretted gabriel s knowledge in the area made a big difference in the development of cradlevent and we felt confident throughout the process their knowledge of pitfalls and requirements concerning documentation was indispensable c2c opens doors as a result of cradlevent s c2c certification ke fibertec has experienced increasing interest especially from building architects who demand sustainable elements in the construction while the ventilation duct was previously referred to the technical advisers table it has now become a part of the vision and the expression colours forms and sustainability have entered the picture where the ventilation ducts of the future are concerned c2c is a good and navigable route we ve entered thanks to gabriel and we re hoping to continue working together in the future the journey has only just begun concludes claus albertsen upholstery will never be the same again forget everything you know about upholstery materials a revolutionary new product has seen the light of day it s a material which makes no compromise with comfort the environment or hygiene it s the sector s revolutionary alternative to pu foam zenxit consists of highly elastic and flexible polyester fibres which are injection-moulded into an elastic three-dimensional network structure the moulding can be varied in density and thickness so ¬≠ the ¬≠material has many areas of use zenxit is extremely breathable water-repellent bacteria-resistant and washable while also maintaining its shape and supporting the body in an appropriate and comfortable manner this means a good upholstery material with good temperature and moisture-regulating properties csr also means giving users an increased quality of life and comfort and zenxit has a promising potential in this direction apart from the purely functional advantages zenxit also has a large number of positive environmental qualities the hazardous chemicals used in the production of traditional pu foam e.g isocyanates which can cause allergy and asthma and in isolated cases can be carcinogenic are not used in the production of zenxit zenxit can also be recycled into new products at the end of its service life zenxit was developed as an alternative to the traditional pu foam on the basis of an environmental agenda but when the product began to take shape it was found that it could also solve several of the sector s challenges with respect to comfort and hygiene zenxit is thus also an outstanding example of how innovation and development can occur when working to solve several problems at the same time csr and environmental

and logistics with one supplier we make our global network of suppliers available and offer a unique shortcut to the highest quality furniture production furnmaster has the expertise the possibilities and the contacts to be able to take over everything from concept and design development to alternative/innovative textile solutions purchasing production and logistics and cover the entire value chain many customers decide to place the total contract with the master because this frees the customer s resources for other activities furnmaster undertakes all or parts of the furniture production from cutting the fabric to upholstering sourcing of components installation and delivery to the customer when we integrate customers furniture production in this way it also means that we collect the waste from the production process at our premises the result is better possibilities for recycling as we have full control of the materials we know their composition and we can ensure the right quality and quantity for subsequent recycling processes one of the products in furnmaster s product range is silentsolution silentsolution is an acoustic solution for customers who want to use sound-absorbing materials with unlimited design possibilities we work with two varieties of silentsolution both consisting of recycled fibres ‚àô‚àô recycled grey is particularly suited to office screening the material is made of recycled cotton wool and synthetic textile fibres plus short polyester fibres and fused fibres ‚àô‚àô recycled white is suitable for covering screens ceilings walls and for other purposes recycled white consists of recycled material from plastic bottles and polyester fibres silent solution is thus an important contribution to the use of textile resources and closed resource cycles which also ensures that at a minimum the raw materials preserve their quality the surplus material is provided by a known supplier thus ensuring the product s content so it is possible to recycle the fibre material in a later production further details at www.gabriel.dk/dk/business-units/furnmaster/ csr and environmental report 32 gabriel business park gabriel s home is on the street hjulmagervej where it all started in 1851 the old factory buildings have now been converted into bright offices with a sound and interesting working environment the property now functions as gabriel s modern head office and the workplace for a large number of companies renting accommodation at gabriel business park gabriel is responsible for operation of the building including emergency plans the most important direct environmental impacts related to gabriel s activities arise in connection with our activities at the address at the business park these are energy heat and water consumption and generation of waste an allocation scheme has been developed for environmental impacts from the various tenants in gabriel business park at the end of the financial year gabriel s share amounted to 54 of the total property area this statement details the business park s total consumption as many of the facilities are shared in consultation with the tenants a system for measuring particularly heavy impacts has been established where the installations are structured so that consumption can be directly attributed to the rooms used by the tenant gabriel no longer needs special environmental permits to emit waste water etc because there is no longer any production in aalborg the requirements regarding noise specified by the city of aalborg are complied with the terms are given under notes the emergency plan has just been updated and gabriel s employees are trained in its use a number of employees have also taken courses in first aid and use of defibrillators other tenants have been informed of the contents of the emergency plan and encouraged to train their employees in its use a significant saving of 27 on energy consumption for heating was obtained in the 2011/12 financial year attributable to improved management of heating including on the weekend but heating has also been discontinued in several places electricity consumption increased by 22 but this is attributable to tenants in the business park with increased activity we also expect a further increase in energy consumption in relation to gabriel s activities as a refrigeration/air conditioning will be established in the old textile factory as of 30 september gabriel ejendomme a/s has rented out about 6,000 m2 corresponding to almost full occupation of the renovated building area management

environment declaration issued by aalborg fjernvarme in the district heating used is primarily waste heat from the production of electricity the proportion of electricity from renewable sources is based on information in energinet.dk s general declaration on electricity emissions related to the production of electricity are based on energinet.dk s environment declaration on electricity for green accounts information on co2 from enerdata is used to calculate emissions related to electricity consumption in lithuania this source is more accurate than what was previously used and retrospective corrections have thus been made the danish gas technology centre s emission calculations for big boilers are used to calculate emissions for natural gas consumption in lithuania emissions of nox and ch4 are not included as the quantities emitted are judged to be insignificant we have noted when reviewing the environmental data that the conversion factor for so2 emissions was used incorrectly the data have therefore been corrected with retrospective effect csr and environmental report waste water emissions of waste water in both aalborg and lithuania correspond to the

recommendations of the industry organisation dansk mode textil gabriel is a participant in dansk mode textil s csr committee for promotion of csr in the industry more details are available at www.dmogt.dk gabriel has initiated a supplier project which will ensure a continued strong and open partnership with suppliers with the emphasis on ongoing optimisation daily following up on gabriel s partners in europe is undertaken by the team from aalborg while gabriel asia pacific undertakes equivalent daily following up on the partners in their region however the development of systems and requirements as well as approval of new suppliers takes place in close dialogue there is a close partnership with gabriel s partly owned dye works uab scandye including ongoing follow-up on environmental projects and improvements the environmental impacts from the processes in the dye works comprise a significant proportion of the environmental impacts attributable to the product during its life the overview of goals and results below shows parts of uab scandye s environmental results in the 2012/13 financial year gabriel only collaborates with good partners in the supplier chain who are capable of meeting the requirements applying to products and services gabriel works actively to select and improve the best possible partners environmental assessment is a high-priority area in follow-ups at suppliers and gabriel s requirements include compliance by the manufacturers with all local regulatory requirements the suppliers are also assessed in relation to gabriel s own environmental requirements and together with the suppliers action plans are implemented to ensure that environmental impacts are regularly reduced the oeko-tex and eu ecolabel schemes also place direct requirements on the suppliers and compliance is verified by a third party partners are expected to comply with gabriel s code of conduct a set of rules which serve to provide guidance with 10 in future gabriel wants to increase the focus on the results obtained in the supply chain and the reporting will thus include key data concerning the most important suppliers activities rather than

relative to last year 11 environmental labelling and certifications gabriel uses generally accepted and internationally recognised product labels and certifications on the product side the eu ecolabel oeko-tex cradle to cradle and the nordic ecolabel the swan were selected as they are widely known and recognised gabriel has frequently been at the forefront within the industry in using new labels in 2002 gabriel was the first upholstery fabric manufacturer in the world to use the eu ecolabel on a large part of the range and in gabriel was the first danish company to gain cradle to cradle product certification the product labelling helps to ensure that there is an objective basis for proving that the communication about the products is true the labelling schemes mean that the product ranges are subject to a number of different requirements and external tests and approvals which are the customer s guarantee of the products performance this applies to both internationally recognised product standards such as those concerning wearability and fireretardant qualities and environmental matters gabriel s requirement is that an environmentally labelled product must be able to comply with all the customer s needs at the same level as or better than a product without the label all gabriel products comply with stringent requirements which reflect the oeko-tex scheme or the eu ecolabel a certification under the cradle to cradle scheme is also included in selected areas and this area is expected to be extended in the future gabriel is certified under iso 9001 iso 14001 and emas this ensures systematic control of all parameters in product development and production and ongoing performance improvements a large quantity of environmental and quality data on gabriel s products is available and can thus offer specific details if a customer wants a particular label on its product for a specific market whether new product labels should be included in the portfolio is regularly identified and prioritised as this can be a route into new markets environmental labelling and certifications goals and results goals 2012/13 all new products must carry either the eu ecolabel or oeko-tex results 2012/13 three new products gained certification under the eu ecolabel eight new products gained certification under oeko-tex in addition a large part of the existing

be referred to as gabriel the report also covers some aspects relating to other companies within the group 4 corporate social responsibility csr is a natural part of the group s activities and to gabriel csr means that the company takes responsibility for adding value which contributes directly and indirectly to a positive development in society the company therefore endorses the principles specified in the un global compact and puts a determined effort into the company s csr and environmental policies being a responsible company is central to the way gabriel is run and is a permanent point on the strategic agenda csr is not a transient fashion phenomenon but a strategic driver on a par with e.g product development and sales gabriel assumes an extraordinary responsibility for how products are produced including in those areas where the group is not the owner we see gabriel s environmental work as a part of our csr and this report relates to both perspectives the purpose of the report is to share information on gabriel s csr and environmental work with the company s stakeholders and commit ourselves to continuous improvement by publicising goals activities and achieved results in accordance with the guidelines in the emas regulation the company s csr and environmental actions in the financial year 2013/14 include increased focus on the description and

involved in a number of national projects and consulted other companies for the purpose of identifying environmental issues and developing csr and environmental strategies the csr work is developed continuously and it is increasingly implemented in close partnership with the company s main ¬≠customers where strong emphasis is also attached to weighing the products csr and environmental impacts there is increased focus on the chemical content of the products and gabriel therefore has constant focus on gaining new knowledge on chemical substances and technologies gabriel supports new focus points and finds that the years of environmental work make it a manageable task to handle new requirements and thus make it easy for the customer to choose the best alternative gabriel will ¬≠continue to focus on ensuring responsible products through product ¬≠certification and has thus in the financial year 2013/14 extended the c2c certification to include selected polyester products the following

value chain from concept to furniture user develops manufactures and sells upholstery fabrics components upholstered surfaces and related products and services gabriel is organised in a number of ¬≠independent strategic business units masters with their own visions objectives strategies and budgets the objective and the policies set the framework for gabriel s csr work including how gabriel works together with selected partners gabriel has an influence on the entire chain from raw materials to the finished upholstered product and the company therefore has a shared responsibility in all stages both locally and globally there is focus on the complete life cycles of services to obtain the largest possible environmental benefit of the efforts this ensures that a step in the life cycle is not optimised without noting how it affects the environmental performance in the following steps it also ensures priority for the effort where the environmental benefit will be greatest significant environmental matters are determined on the basis of systematic surveys including measurements of input raw ¬≠materials water chemicals and energy measurements of output waste water scrap and emissions and setting up of key figures gabriel also continuously monitors the analyses and reports of institutes authorities and others who are thoroughly familiar with environmental matters in order to identify relevant concerns the surveys show that the following must be regarded as the most important environmental matters in the products life cycle ‚àô‚àô raw materials new zealand wool ‚àô‚àô raw materials polyester fibres ‚àô‚àô raw materials other products used in upholstery e.g foam metal and plastic ‚àô‚àô energy consumption and waste water especially in washing dyeing and finishing treatment ‚àô‚àô consumption of chemicals ‚àô‚àô scrap from production ‚àô‚àô waste water ‚àô‚àô transport of raw materials and finished goods ‚àô‚àô disposal including recycling of the products these matters relate primarily to suppliers and customers ¬≠activities indirect environmental impacts gabriel works to a high degree with these matters in cooperation with suppliers and customers it is therefore essential that gabriel has a good relationship with these partners to ensure communication of requirements and goals environmental matters related directly to gabriel s activities and properties ‚àô‚àô consumption of energy and heating ‚àô‚àô noise ‚àô‚àô generation of waste ‚àô‚àô transport for customer and supplier visits and other meetings high-priority areas gabriel s efforts are described under seven main areas which form the basis for implementing objectives and policies for csr and the environment these seven prioritised areas were chosen under the following criteria ‚àô‚àô matters prioritised by gabriel s csr and environmental policies ‚àô‚àô matters judged important by legislation ‚àô‚àô matters judged important in product labelling including c2c oeko-tex and the eu ecolabel ‚àô‚àô matters where gabriel has an influence on effecting an improvement ‚àô‚àô the relative importance of environmental matters the seven main areas ‚àô‚àô materials and resources ‚àô‚àô responsible production and supply chain management ‚àô‚àô environmental labelling and certifications ‚àô‚àô quality and environmental management systems ‚àô‚àô development and innovation ‚àô‚àô the working environment ‚àô‚àô gabriel erhvervspark these areas are discussed in greater depth on the following pages which provide an overview of our positions activities performed results and new

raw materials and good ¬≠conditions for the sheep this type of wool possesses unique dyeing properties where the dye is absorbed into the fibre the material also absorbs light which results in very attractive colours with lots of depth and no reflections wool maintains its attractive appearance in use assuring the finished product a long service life gabriel uses only high quality raw wool thus avoiding many chemical finishing treatments due to gabriel s life cycle approach we work on a continuous basis on how to recycle resources for use in other products or applications after use with particular focus on retaining the high value of the resources this means that the components can be handled as ordinary non-toxic waste or recycled in new products after use polyester polyester has come to comprise a significant part of gabriel s product range in recent years polyester is the world s most used fibre and it has properties which make it suitable for furniture fabric polyester can also be recycled in other products after use as an example gabriel offers the product comfort+ which ¬≠consists of 37 recycled polyester the work is ongoing to discover the possibilities for increasing the proportion of fabrics based on recycled material gabriel works only with suppliers who can deliver high quality polyester yarns which meet gabriel s environmental requirements furniture upholstery and upholstery solutions with gabriel s expansion within the business unit furnmaster s activities gabriel s responsibility for buying materials to be used for the assembly of furniture parts is increasing raw material components are selected in close dialogue with customers and gabriel advises to the extent possible on selection of components and suppliers who meet gabriel s requirements with respect to the environment quality and csr 10 control of chemicals chemicals are required in the production processes but gabriel controls the choice and use of dyes and chemicals in our suppliers ¬≠ production the following are therefore not used ‚àô‚àô chlorine compounds ‚àô‚àô organic solvents ‚àô‚àô dyes containing heavy metals ‚àô‚àô dyes and pigments which can give off carcinogens ‚àô‚àô pvc ‚àô‚àô bromine-containing flame retardants ‚àô‚àô silver ions or other bactericidal treatments ‚àô‚àô anti-moth impregnation ‚àô‚àô other substances classified as carcinogenic

ongoing and the goal remains obtain fsc certification of wood products at furnmaster uab gain ce-labelling of zenxit the new upholstery material to allow testing and launching in special applications ce-labelling gained specifically within health care a furniture product with zenxit gained certification under the nordic ecolabel scheme the swan the goal has been achieved carry out a life cycle analysis to document zenxit s environmental impact objectives 2013/14 carry out a development project u ¬≠ sing recycled yarn as a component there is substantial focus on the ¬≠possibilities of establishing closed-¬≠ loop material cycles nationally and ¬≠internationally and gabriel will follow and be directly involved in these projects results 2013/14 development projects using r¬≠ ecycled yarn as a component were carried out this resulted in c2c certification of selected polyester designs gabriel followed and continues to f¬≠ ollow developments within closedloop m ¬≠ aterial cycles among other things ¬≠gabriel was project m ¬≠ anager on an ¬≠industrial s¬≠ ymbiosis project and is ¬≠participating in a phd project on closed-loop material cycles objectives 2014/15 gabriel will continue to follow developments within closed-loop cycles actively and be involved in projects dealing with recirculation within both product and system development the potential of closed-loop cycles will be uncovered e.g through n ¬≠ etworks and in study and research projects intensified monitoring of global ¬≠environmental legislation together with the industry organisation for the purpose of continuously i¬≠ncreasing gabriel s knowledge of industry-specific legislation 11 responsible production ¬≠ and supply chain management gabriel only collaborates with suppliers who are capable of meeting the requirements applying to products and services and gabriel works actively to select the best possible partners continuous follow-up and assessment of environmental matters is a high-priority area and gabriel requires manufacturers to comply with all local regulatory requirements and gabriel s own environmental requirements accordingly action plans are prepared and implemented together with suppliers to ensure that environmental impacts are continually reduced strategic partners must follow high demands the term strategic partner covers those companies in the supply chain which are of the greatest importance to gabriel the requirements cover all areas in the value-adding process the efficiency and value of the relation is therefore measured by categorising the relation and creating a risk profile where the value-adding processes ¬≠including design and product development logistics quality production environment csr and working environment as well as willingness and ability to improve are evaluated by the parties the oeko-tex and eu ecolabel labelling schemes ensure compliance with the manufacturing requirements for products to be verified by third parties gabriel follows up on partners compliance with gabriel s code of conduct a set of rules which serve to provide guidance with respect to business ethics and to help our employees to maintain ethical behaviour the code of conduct is developed on the basis of the un global compact and is in accordance with the recommendations of the industry ¬≠organisation dansk mode textil throughout the supply chain efforts are made to create ¬≠responsible and sustainable results it is important for gabriel to take responsibility not only for financial earnings but also for ¬≠environmental sustainability and social justice gabriel has this in mind at all times and seeks to create a synergy effect between these perspectives to ensure a sustainable result as an example gabriel is trying to avoid waste through the supply chain for fi ¬≠ nancial as well as environmental reasons textile waste which can not be used commercially is used for charity in the local c¬≠ ommunity and projects such as blindes arbejde and projekt √∏st a responsible supply chain network day-to-day dialogues are undertaken by gabriel s team in aalborg with respect to european partners and by gabriel asia pacific with respect to partners in that region however the development of systems and requirements as well as approval of new suppliers take place in close dialogue furnmaster offers unique services in furniture upholstery and upholstery solutions and is an integrated part of gabriel a/s s quality management system via the project strategic cooperation in the supply chain gabriel has been focusing on the development of supplier relationship management the project includes increased cooperation with and across key suppliers since all links in the chain are responsible for delivering services and products which meet the csr environmental and quality objectives this is a key element in creating a strong and transparent supply chain network 12 gabriel is continuously striving to establish a supply chain which provides a good and responsible working environment therefore gabriel places high priority on choosing partners who provide proper conditions and comply with gabriel s code of conduct and who actively and continuously strive to improve conditions through strengthened cooperation and good relations mutual understanding between companies is achieved and joint ¬≠development plans can be prepared for the partnerships strong partnerships also help to ensure that gabriel s requirements are communicated to other suppliers in the supply chain csr environmental report 2013/14  responsible production and supplier management goals and results goals 2013/14 minimum five masters obtain an individual certification at the end of the 2013/14 financial year this involves assessment by the individual master of its core processes and services including how quality and environmental conditions influence the master s services continue to increase the proportion of sea transport from china and at a minimum maintain it at 98.5 results 2013/14 goals 2014/15 one master obtained certification as the main focus was on developing and ¬≠re-launching gabriel s management ¬≠system to a more user-friendly platform this includes updating the company s core ¬≠processes and the individual masters processes to ¬≠allow all masters to obtain individual certification at least three more masters obtain a ¬≠certification at the end of the 2014/15 f¬≠inancial year the proportion between sea and air t¬≠ransport indicates that 91.2 of the goods produced in china are carried by sea gabriel s work on optimisation of transport is continuing so that most goods will be transported by ship or lorry which is ¬≠important from both an environmental and a financial point of view increase the proportion of sea transport from china to minimum 94 gain emas certification for the dye works uab scandye the focus was on optimisation of ¬≠ production processes with the main ¬≠emphasis on reducing waste water energy resources chemicals and packaging based on lean principles the goal is closed environmental considerations at scandye are therefore still managed in accordance with iso 14001 which is considered s¬≠ ufficient at the moment uab scandye continues to set ¬≠reduction targets to obtain ongoing improvements which will be included in the future ¬≠extended reporting of key data for suppliers the water consumption was 131 l/kg fabric a reduction of 8 relative to last year the goal to reduce consumption remains and will be included in the extended ¬≠reporting of key data for suppliers the electricity consumption was 1.37 kwh/kg fabric a decrease of 9 relative to last year the gas consumption was 0.92 m3/kg fabric a decrease of 9 relative to last year objectives 2013/14 extend reporting to include key data ¬≠concerning the key suppliers csr results establish a number of indicators to be included in the reporting for the next period results 2013/14 a new management tool for collection of key data is being implemented and a pilot project has been carried out the purpose of these new actions is to present a broad picture of activities and results in the supply network the reporting will thus include key data for the most important suppliers i¬≠ ndicators have been established and the ¬≠reporting is being implemented objectives 2014/15 the extended reporting of key suppliers csr results and performance continues and the results are assessed on an ¬≠ongoing basis 13 environmental labelling and certifications environmental and quality data on all gabriel s products are available and the company can thus offer specific details if a customer wants a particular label on the product for a specific market whether new product labels should be included in the portfolio is regularly identified and prioritised as this can be a way into new markets product labelling helps to ensure that there is an objective basis for proving that the communication about the products is ¬≠accurate the labelling schemes mean that the product ranges are subject to a number of different requirements and external tests and approvals which are the customer s guarantee of the products performance this applies to both internationally recognised product standards such as those concerning wearability and fireretardant qualities as well as environmental matters gabriel s requirement is that an environmentally labelled product must be able to comply with all the customer s needs at the same level as or better than a product without the label gabriel uses internationally recognised product labels and ¬≠certifications on the product side the eu ecolabel oeko-tex cradle to cradle and the nordic ecolabel the swan are s¬≠ elected as they are widely known and recognised gabriel strives to be at the forefront within the industry in using new labels with potential in 2002 gabriel was the first

resources materials and resources objectives and results objectives 2014/15 using the best materials and eliminating problematic chemical content is a key priority for gabriel when designing and producing high-quality products wool gabriel has a long-term partnership with wools of new zealand which guarantees high-quality raw materials and good ¬≠conditions for the sheep this type of wool possesses unique dyeing properties where the dye is absorbed into the fibre the material also absorbs light which results in very attractive colours with plenty of depth and no reflections wool maintains its attractive appearance in use assuring a long service life for the end-product gabriel uses only high-quality raw wool thus avoiding many chemical finishing treatments polyester polyester has come to comprise a significant part of gabriel s product range in recent years polyester is the world s most used fibre and has properties which make it suitable for furniture fabric polyester can also be recycled in other fabrics and products after use as an example gabriel offers the products elevation and repetto which ¬≠consist of 100 recycled polyester work is ongoing to discover ways of increasing the proportion of fabrics based on recycled material gabriel works only with suppliers who can deliver high-quality polyester yarns which meet gabriel s environmental requirements as ordinary non-toxic waste or recycled in new products after use gabriel has financial as well as environmental reasons for trying to avoid waste throughout the supply chain waste fabric which can not be used commercially is used for charity in the local communities gabriel group increase the proportion of sea transport from china to a minimum of 94 control of chemicals results 2014/15 objectives 2015/16 result for is 93.6 and result for as of 30.09.2015 is 99.0 maintain share of sea transport from china at a minimum of 98.5 gabriel group continue involvement in projects focused on recirculation and circular economy gabriel is part of a ph.d. project which focuses on new requirements regarding furniture take-back schemes and related business models key stakeholders have been interviewed and analyses are ongoing immediate results indicate that stakeholders are interested but different obstacles are also identified conduct circular economy workshop with selected stakeholders to further strengthen cooperation and prioritise further actions gabriel group intensified monitoring of global environmental legislation together with industry organisation for the purpose of continuously increasing gabriel s knowledge of industry-specific legislation procedures for monitoring and evaluating environmental legislation have been updated gabriel constantly receives intelligence through dansk fashion and textile dm t the objective has been achieved ‚Äò chemicals are required in the production processes and gabriel controls the choice and use of dyes and chemicals in our suppliers ¬≠production the following are examples of what is not used ‚àô‚àô chlorine compounds ‚àô‚àô organic solvents ‚àô‚àô dyes containing heavy metals ‚àô‚àô dyes and pigments which can

requirements for fabric performance gabriel group update internal minimum requirements document gabriel general requirements and include furniture components energy water and climate change furniture upholstery and upholstery solutions gabriel s expansion within the activities of furnmaster business unit is increasing gabriel s responsibility for buying materials to be used for the assembly of furniture parts raw materials are selected in close dialogue with customers and gabriel advises as far as possible on the selection of components and suppliers who meet gabriel s environmental quality and csr requirements recycling when designing for recyclability it is a priority not to mix different types of material due to gabriel s life cycle approach we work continuously on how to recycle resources for use in other products or applications after use with a particular focus on preserving the high value of the resources this means that the components can be handled 10 gabriel is monitoring significant energy and water consumption on its own premises and sets reduction targets when potential is identified as an example the share of transport by sea is monitored both to reduce emission of co2 and thereby climate change but also to ensure the most costeffective transport energy and water are essential for suppliers production processes gabriel monitors performance of key suppliers through sharing of targets and progress the two suppliers accountable for the largest share of gabriel products have switched to 100 renewable energy the energy is provided at the same cost but with significantly reduced co2-emission and climate change impacts  gabriel group participate in danish chemical management initiative focusing on substitution reach and supply chain cooperation input findings to gabriel management system project is finalised gabriel has shared knowledge on chemical management at suppliers the objective has been achieved furnmaster obtain fsc certification of wood products there have not yet been any customer requests related to fsccertified products the feasibility of an fsc certification is evaluated continuously and initiated when relevant zenxit carry out a life cycle analysis to document environmental impacts of zenxit analysis is completed main finding is that recycling is a priority when further improving environmental performance of zenxit the objective has been achieved 11 csr report 2014/15 responsible production ¬≠ and supply chain management responsible production and supplier management objectives and results objectives 2014/15 gabriel only collaborates with suppliers who are capable of meeting the requirements applicable to products and services and works actively to select the best possible partners throughout the supply chain efforts are made to achieve responsible and sustainable results it is important for gabriel to take responsibility not only for financial earnings but also for environmental sustainability and social justice gabriel has this in mind at all times and seeks to create synergy between these perspectives a responsible supply chain network during 2013-15 gabriel has focused on the development of supplier relationship management via the strategic cooperation in the supply chain project the project includes increased cooperation with and across key suppliers since all links in the chain are responsible for delivering services and products which meet the csr environmental and quality objectives this is a key element in creating a strong and transparent supply chain network no objectives regarding this project were included in the 2013/14 csr report there are therefore no such objectives in this years overview though the project did generate a number of improvements which are presented below strategic partners must meet high demands the term strategic partner covers those companies in the supply chain which are most important to gabriel the requirements cover all areas in the value chain the efficiency and value of the relationship is now measured by categorising it and creating a risk profile in which the value-adding processes are evaluated across parties in gabriel these processes includes the suppliers capabilities within design and product development logistics quality production the environment csr aspects like respecting human rights the working environment as well as willingness and ability to improve in relation to csr gabriel specifically follows up partners compliance with the code of conduct gabriel is continuously striving to establish a supply chain which provides a good and responsible working environment therefore gabriel places a high priority on choosing partners who provide proper conditions comply with gabriel s code of conduct and actively and continuously strive to improve conditions results 2014/15 gabriel group include csr performance data related to strategic partners in the csr report ‚Äò at the start of a partnership with a new supplier the supplier is introduced to and must sign the code of conduct gabriel seeks to understand operating practices in the new countries it might enter but also uses its influence to have the supplier implement management systems for instance potential risks are evaluated and actions to manage these in ongoing operations are defined and monitored through followup audits and ongoing communication for example a team of gabriel employees conducted a thorough on-site review of a new chinese supplier in autumn together with a chinese audit team from a recognised company all relevant operational controls in the facility were checked and a social compliance audit was completed before deciding whether to continue engagement with the supplier the social compliance audit included check of non-discrimination minimum wage and social benefits all available csr data regarding strategic partners have been assessed for gabriel fabrics suppliers and csr objectives are constantly added to internal supply chain management tool objectives 2015/16 the csr report sets and communicates relevant indicators regarding csr performance of strategic partners for the entire gabriel group gabriel group update materiality assessment regarding human rights anti-corruption climate and environment as well as social aspects in the value chain plan to act on findings in policies plans tools

aalborg are in daily dialogue with european partners while gabriel asia pacific engages with partners in that region the development of systems and requirements as well as approval of new suppliers takes place in close dialogue furnmaster offers unique services in furniture upholstery and upholstery solutions and is part of the group s quality management system relevant employees receive training in csr both to understand what gabriel requires and to be able to explain the gabriel values and expectations to suppliers furnmaster sp z.o.o complete environmental mapping as basis for prioritising future projects set up system for tracking main resource consumption identify and prioritise projects to reduce waste the evaluations are shared with strategic partners as this paves the way for mutual understanding of expectations between companies and joint development plans can be prepared for the partnerships strong and long-term partnerships also help to ensure that gabriel s requirements are communicated to subcontractors on the supply chain continuous follow-up is a high-priority area and gabriel requires manufacturers to comply with all local regulations and gabriel s

implement the required actions and finally measure the result based on the result an assessment is made of whether actions and goal are adequate or whether to make improvements and set new goals iso 9001 focuses on parameters of significance for a company s quality performance while iso 14001 concerns the matters of significance for the company s environmental ¬≠performance an important tool in this is the audit which assesses whether the systems are functioning as planned environmental labelling and management systems quality and environmental management systems product labelling helps to ensure an objective basis for proving that the communication about our products is accurate the labelling schemes mean that the product ranges are subject to a number of different requirements and external tests and approvals which are the customer s guarantee of product performance this applies to both internationally recognised product standards such as those concerning wearability and fire-retardant qualities and environmental impacts gabriel s requirement is that an environmentally labelled product must meet all customer needs as well as or better than a product without the label

these policies as amended on the basis of constructive input from the workshop with the subsidiaries managing directors to be implemented at the subsidiaries in with support from local law firms in

however one more obvious consequence of a supplier failing to meet the requirements made by h+h in a purchasing agreement could be that h+h terminates the agreement if dialogue with the supplier on

beyond h+h 's suppliers being contractually obliged under group-wide agreements concluded since autumn to comply with certain standards to ensure ethical business conduct and acceptable working conditions for their employees and those of their suppliers in addition awareness at the subsidiaries of the importance of familiarity and compliance with legislative requirements with regard to anti-competitive behaviour and corruption has without doubt increased since the workshop was held although it should be noted here that several of the subsidiaries already had local policies on competition law and anti-corruption in place and were therefore already very aware of these issues 2/2

covered by the auditors report in h+h international a/s 's annual report for csr in general h+h international a/s is committed to being a socially responsible company establishing and maintaining a robust corporate governance structure and culture and communicating openly and transparently on its efforts to build a sustainable business h+h develops produces and sells aircrete building materials in northern and eastern europe h+h s vision is to be the overall preferred supplier of aircrete building products within its geographical markets and h+h wants to achieve this goal in a responsible and ethical way currently h+h s strategy and business are based on sound ethical conduct with respect for human rights and labour rights and zero tolerance for corruption furthermore there is a focus on sustainability in h+h s business by constantly improving the thermal insulation properties of its aircrete products and seeking to minimise the impact of its operational activities on the environment and the climate h+h has a business-oriented csr strategy with a focus on the following three areas fair and safe employment standards terms of employment shall be fair and non-discriminatory and comply with internationally declared human rights and labour rights and the working environment shall be safe and healthy sustainable business practices business practices in r d production marketing sales logistics and administration as well as the use of h+h s products shall take account of their effects on the environment and the climate ethical business practices business practices shall be free from any form of corruption for many years h+h has based its business on csr principles in practice despite only having unwritten csr-oriented principles rather than formal written csr group policies csrrelated policies and actions have been implemented locally in the various country subsidiaries on the basis of local legislation trends and to some extent traditions meaning that the subsidiaries were already aware of and practised csr when the group-based csr work was initiated 1/5 14 march published at www.hplush.com/governance-statement in h+h began to coordinate its csr policies and initiatives e.g by developing a group policy on supply chain management h+h code of conduct for suppliers this sets out certain minimum requirements for suppliers and their suppliers in respect of employment standards business ethics especially the avoidance of corruption and the effects of the supplier s business on the environment and the climate so far the code of conduct has only been applied to central purchasing for large parts of the h+h group or the whole h+h group but the intention is also to develop a parallel but less complex code of conduct to be used by subsidiaries with smaller local suppliers the development and updating of group-based csr policies has been ongoing since is expected to be a key year in h+h s csr-related work since it is the intention that a structured compliance organisation including csr compliance will be established in the h+h group in order to support and strengthen continuous development implementation training and auditing of compliance with regard to csr policies the organisation will include regional compliance officers who will serve as central points of contact and coordinators for h+h international a/s when it comes to implementing sustaining monitoring and reporting on the various compliance policies as h+h s first group csr policies were initiated in and a compliance organisation will not be established until a more complete policy structure is not expected to be in place until the end of the current strategy period in due to the infancy of h+h s group-based csr work it is not yet possible to quantify or otherwise report more specifically on the results or effects of its csr work so far key csr focus area employment standards fair non-discriminatory and safe csr principles and policies one of h+h s primary assets is its employees and their know-how and experience therefore the motivation and wellbeing of employees is a key factor for the development of h+h a guiding principle for h+h s strategy and business activities is the recognition of generally acknowledged labour rights and human rights these include but are not limited to freedom of organisation for all h+h employees h+h s provision of equal opportunities regardless of gender religion colour ethnic or national origin and political convictions and a ban on child labour and forced labour furthermore h+h is to be a safe place to work and is always to comply with all applicable statutory health safety requirements h+h is also to be an attractive place to work with possibilities for professional development and a good work-life balance as for specific policies h+h developed group health safety policies for lost-time accident reporting and investigation safety principles and compliance in this is the first step in establishing a group-wide health safety management system and culture from words into action in connection with the implementation of the new health safety policies in h+h implemented a group safety officer function and increased reporting requirements the main objective is to minimise the risk of accidents for our employees and ensure compliance with regulations and transfer of best practices 2/5 14 march published at www.hplush.com/governance-statement csr results in and expectations for the future the main activity in was to establish group-wide systems for capturing and learning from accidents this was done by establishing common definitions reporting and investigation tools all meetings in the operational organisation now start with a discussion of health safety issues in order to emphasise their importance finally safety statistics are reported on a monthly basis both to h+h international a/s s management group and to the board of directors the companies in the h+h group represent different skills international experience nationalities ages and genders recruitment for management positions takes place with an emphasis on skills and experience and without discrimination on the grounds of age gender nationality etc subsidiaries management teams are generally diverse with people of different nationalities ages and genders working as managers within production sales marketing and administration h+h international a/s s organisation is very small with only 13 employees including the two members of the executive board of whom five are women and eight are men the board of directors consists of five shareholder-elected board members of which one is a woman and two are of nationalities other than danish h+h international a/s has not set any objectives or produced any policies to ensure diversity in the company s management due to the very small size of its organisation the limited number of employees means there are only limited or no changes in the organisation in any given year which makes it very difficult to effectively pursue any diversity objectives or policy within a meaningful time frame key csr focus area sustainable business practices environment and climate csr principles and policies aircrete is a particularly eco-friendly building material not only because of its excellent thermal insulation properties but also because the production of aircrete is easy on the environment and at the end of its life aircrete can be recycled into new aircrete products or used for other purposes the primary materials used in the production of aircrete are cement lime and sand all of which are based on abundantly available natural resources at some of h+h s production facilities pfa pulverised fuel ash a residual product from power generation at coal-fired power stations is used as a raw material instead of sand as a guiding principle h+h is to consider the environmental and climate impact when defining r d objectives and when producing selling and distributing its products h+h continuously seeks to develop its production processes products and business practices in ways that can increase the sustainability of its business and of the aircrete products themselves h+h does not currently have any group policies in place concerning the effects of its business practices on the environment and the climate but it is the intention that such policies will be developed from words into action environmental audits are performed regularly at the different production facilities most recently audits were carried out at the now closed production facility in finland as well as the production facilities in poland and all confirmed that aircrete production takes place without any direct pollution or other negative effects on the land or surroundings of the production facilities 3/5 14 march published at www.hplush.com/governance-statement environmental product declarations epds for aircrete products from cradle to gate were developed in and h+h s products in three countries will be marketed with epds from early i.e long before epds become mandatory which is not expected to be for some years the epd scheme is based on an eu directive and the overall goal is to provide relevant verified and comparable information about the environmental impact of goods and services an epd includes information on the environmental impact stemming from the use of raw materials and energy the content of materials and chemical substances any emissions to air soil or water and any generation of waste csr results in and expectations for the future h+h carried out numerous activities in to increase the sustainability of its business these included a sharpened focus on reducing product waste i.e surplus aircrete from the production process and damaged aircrete products to support this focus product waste reduction targets were included in the bonus scheme for some key production managers any product waste generated is recycled by crushing it and either re-introducing it into the production process or selling it as road fill or cat litter a project to increase heat recovery from the autoclaving process was also initiated at one of h+h s factories in in order to reduce energy consumption in the production process another focus area in was to reduce the consumption of binders such as cement and lime both of which entail relatively high energy consumption during their production process furthermore a project was launched in late to reduce water consumption during the production process reducing the water content of products not only leads to reduced consumption of water but also has the added benefit that the weight of the finished products will be lower making their distribution more efficient thereby reducing co2 emissions as more aircrete products can be carried by each truck before reaching its maximum permitted load another means to successfully reduce the consumption of raw materials was to develop and implement procedures to more closely scrutinise and measure the consumption of raw materials when mixing the ingredients for the aircrete slurry h+h plans to continue the roll-out of cradle-to-gate epds as described above in the marketing of its aircrete products in finally h+h intends to establish environmental policies in the coming years that support its overall strategy key csr focus area ethical business practices anti-corruption csr principles and policies h+h is committed to lawful and ethical behaviour in financial and accounting matters as well as other activities and requires its employees to conduct themselves in a manner that complies with all applicable laws and regulations as a guiding principle h+h is not to participate in corruption bribery or extortion of any kind h+h shall act in a credible and ethically responsible manner on a more specific level h+h began working in on a group policy on anti-corruption h+h anti-corruption compliance policy the policy will be fully rolled out and implemented as soon as the csr organisation is established which is expected to be in 4/5 14 march published at www.hplush.com/governance-statement from words into action once drafted the h+h anti-corruption policy was presented and discussed at length at a workshop attended by all of the subsidiaries managing

directors for their role in implementing the policies locally at the subsidiaries as a consequence of the h+h group s transition to a functional structure in the implementation of the anti-corruption policy at the subsidiaries was postponed until when the establishment of a compliance organisation with the appointment of a local compliance officer at each subsidiary is completed csr results in and expectations for the future the effects of the work on the anti-corruption policy are not visible or measurable as such but will be manifested indirectly through h+h not engaging in corruption late in the board of directors decided that h+h will develop and implement a code of conduct in applicable to all employees the code will expand on h+h s existing guiding principles introduce new principles and provide guidance on how to handle various issues in areas such as anti-corruption and other forms of legal compliance as well as issues relating to human rights and labour rights climate and environment and conflicts of interest furthermore in conjunction with the decision to develop a code of conduct and in order to underpin and support the code of conduct as well as other group policies such as the anticorruption policy the code of conduct for suppliers etc. the board of directors decided that a whistleblower scheme should be established the design of this scheme including the development of a whistleblower policy etc. and the subsequent submission of requests for approval from the relevant national data protection agencies are planned to be carried out during 2014-2015

important for establishing and continuously strengthening the group-wide health safety management system and culture safety first from words to action since h+h operates in and sources only from europe h+h assumes that all generally recognised human rights are adhered to by its suppliers and h+h does not know of any breach of human rights by h+h or its suppliers 2/7 17 march published at www.hplush.com/csr-statement h+h has therefore decided to focus its csr activities on the issue of safe working conditions for its employees especially in relation to its production facilities in connection with the implementation of the group s health safety policies h+h has implemented various group-wide initiatives with a particular focus on benchmarking and sharing best practices among the h+h entities to demonstrate the importance of these policies all meetings and reporting between the group coo and the various production managers always have as their first agenda item an update on the policies and any specific actions and incidents reported the main objective of all these activities is to maintain a continuous focus on the policies and their principles and thereby minimise the risk of accidents for employees and ensure compliance with regulations csr results in and expectations for the future the main result achieved in was completion of the external work safety audit of the production facilities in the uk and russia for external safety audit of the production facilities in poland and germany will be carried out the frequency of lost hours flh development in has been on the right downward trend whereas the frequency of accidents fra development has been non-satisfactory it seems that part of the increase in fras may be due to the ongoing efforts to improve the level of health and safety incidents being reported since when the ratio of incidents being reported increase meaning incidents are reported and registered rather than forgotten the number of reported incidents will often also increase likewise since the work towards achieving reporting of all incidents will continue during in consequence it must be expected that the efforts to get accurate reporting may drive up the fra frequency even further in parallel actions and initiatives to bring the number of incidents down will naturally be implemented during and onwards part of such actions and initiatives are developed on the basis of the lessons learned from the flh and fra reports as for employees rights to privacy including protection of their personal data h+h is in the midst of mapping all the personal data in the h+h group and a group policy on handling storage retention etc of the employees personal data will be issued in as part of h+h s current work towards becoming compliant with the eu general data protection regulation one of the major risks for both the work to improve health safety as well as the work to handle personal data in line with the requirements under the eu general data protection regulation is that the success within both areas depends to a large degree on changing human interaction i.e employee processes procedures and habits and that can only be done in a sustainable way if the culture is changed which by experience often takes some time the hardware e.g equipment and other material and the software you need in order to implement different ways of working can relatively effortlessly be bought in and implemented but without a simultaneous change of the mindset of employees the set goals within the two areas may not be fully reached and the results achieved may not last h+h is therefore very aware that improvement within the said two areas require continuous focus on good management communication and engagement non-financial key indicators h+h uses several non-financial key indicators to measure the results and effects of its work to ensure fair safe and healthy working conditions for its employees such as the number of work-related accidents leading to absence from work the number of work-related accidents not leading to absence from work and the frequency of lost production hours due to accidents developments in the key indicators for health safety are reported monthly to the board of directors of h+h international a/s 3/7 17 march published at www.hplush.com/csr-statement key csr focus area environment and climate sustainable business practices csr policies aircrete is a particularly eco-friendly building material not only because of its excellent thermal insulation properties but also because the production of aircrete is easy on the environment and at the end of its life aircrete can be recycled into new aircrete products or used for other purposes such as cat litter and road fill the primary materials used in the production of aircrete are cement lime and sand all of which are based on abundantly available natural resources at some of h+h s production facilities pfa pulverised fuel ash a residual product from coal-fired power stations is used as a raw material instead of sand to help ensure that sustainability is always considered when h+h does business h+h has incorporated principles concerning the environment and climate in its code of conduct these include h+h will comply with all environmental legislation and ensure that its suppliers commit to do the same h+h will improve the utilisation of resources energy efficiency emissions and waste minimisation innovation within h+h products and processes shall among other be environmentally driven in addition to the principles set out in the group code of conduct some h+h subsidiaries have local csr policies relating to the climate and the environment from words to action internal environmental audits are performed regularly at the various production facilities the internal audits all document that aircrete production takes place without any direct pollution or other negative effects on the land or surroundings of the production facilities environmental product declarations epds for aircrete products from cradle to gate have been developed and some of h+h s products are already being marketed with epds the epd scheme is based on an eu regulation and the overall goal is to provide relevant verified and comparable information about the environmental impact of goods and services an epd includes information on the environmental impact stemming from the use of raw materials and energy the content of materials and chemical substances any emissions to air soil or water and any generation of waste 4/7 17 march published at www.hplush.com/csr-statement csr results in and expectations for the future h+h carried out numerous activities in to increase the sustainability of its business these included an even sharper focus on reducing product waste i.e surplus aircrete from the production process and damaged aircrete products to support this focus product waste reduction targets are set any product waste generated is recycled by crushing it and either reintroducing it into the production process or selling it as road fill or cat litter a continued focus area in was to reduce the consumption of binders such as cement and lime both of which entail relatively high energy consumption in their production furthermore a project is ongoing to reduce water consumption during the production process reducing the water content of products not only leads to reduced consumption of water but also has the added benefit that the weight of the finished products will be lower this makes their distribution more efficient and thereby reduces co2 emissions as more aircrete products can be carried by each truck before reaching its maximum permitted load h+h plans to continue the roll-out of cradle-to-gate epds as described above in the marketing of its aircrete products one relevant risk with regard to h+h s work on reducing its environmental and climatic footprint would be a failure to ensure that h+h s suppliers adhere to the relevant parts of h+h s code of conduct to mitigate this risk h+h tries to screen its suppliers and contact any supplier where h+h becomes aware of critical negative environmental or climate issues relating to that supplier s production non-financial key indicators h+h uses several non-financial key indicators to measure the results and effects of its work to improve the environmental and climatic effects of its activities these non-financial indicators include the number and content of complaints received from neighbours of the production facilities the number and content of any negative notifications received from the authorities and the number and extent of any non-compliance with relevant laws and/or permits and licences key csr focus area business ethics fair and lawful competition csr policies h+h is committed to lawful and ethical behaviour in all business financial and accounting matters as well as other activities and requires its employees to conduct themselves in a manner that complies with all applicable laws and regulations to help ensure good business ethics at h+h relevant principles have been included in its code of conduct these include all h+h employees are under an obligation to comply with applicable competition law and adhere to the group s competition law compliance policy h+h condemns corruption and all h+h employees are under an obligation to comply with applicable anti-bribery laws and adhere to the group s anti-corruption policy entertainment and gifts given or received by h+h employees may not exceed reasonable limits and may not be provided in an attempt to gain undue commercial advantage h+h shall not participate in money laundering hence no h+h employees may receive payments likely to stem from criminal activities 5/7 17 march published at www.hplush.com/csr-statement as for specific policies further supporting the above principles on business ethics set out in the h+h code of conduct h+h has developed a group competition compliance policy as well as a group anti-corruption policy each policy sets out in detail the dos and don ts for h+h s employees with respect to various issues and situations related to competition law as well as to corruption that h+h employees may be confronted with during their work from words to action to support implementation and continued training and awareness of h+h s group policies on e.g competition compliance and anti-corruption h+h has established a digital policy management software system with a portal where policies can be accessed at all times read and digital quizzes and tests in each policy must be passed on a regular basis by all relevant employees to document that a given policy has not only been read but also understood the portal also contains a video in which h+h s group ceo promotes the policies and the importance of compliance to keep the policies alive and market them various awareness material such as posters small handy brochures etc have also been prepared and publication will take place in the beginning of after translation into all relevant languages and be followed up with the release of new additional awareness material on a regular basis to continuously remind all employees about the policies finally a whistleblower portal was developed and launched first on h+h international s website and launch on the various national websites shall follow in the first quarter of after proper translation csr results in and expectations for the future has been a key year in h+h s work on business ethics all policies are now developed the underlying it infrastructure is fully established and a group compliance organisation is in place before the end of the first quarter of it is expected that all employees within procurement sales and administration have received all relevant training in the relevant policies and before end of all production personnel has been trained in the relevant policies for them the training for production personnel takes longer time since meetings must be held at each production facility and for each shift due to the early stage of h+h s work on group business ethics including compliance with competition law and avoidance of corruption it is not yet possible to quantify or otherwise report more specifically on the results or effects of this work once the whistleblower system has been in place for a few years reporting in anonymous form on the number and the types of incidents reported conclusions and consequences will be possible h+h aims to communicate within the group on any relevant incidences of non-compliance in order to illustrate the importance of compliance as well as the consequences that non-compliance may have for h+h and relevant employees suppliers customers etc similar to the work with health safety and personal data protection see above compliance with group business ethics is dependent on the right culture being in place among employees and the risk is that if such culture is not being nurtured at all times and at all levels the awareness of group business ethics quickly diminishes to ensure that all employees are aware of the group business ethics h+h tries to ensure engagement and awareness by continuously communicating and training employees in the group policies relevant to their job function non-financial key indicators due to the early stage of h+h s work on group business ethics non-financial key indicators have not yet been developed 6/7 17 march published at

a strong corporate culture in this connection harboe is pleased that its staff turnover is low and that seniority for both production workers and specialists is at a level which ensures continuity and maintains the valuable knowledge gathered in the company at the same time it is extremely satisfactory that the number of employees with very few or no days off sick is extremely high at the beginning of a formal review and assessment of the psychological working environment at harboe s production unit in sk√¶lsk√∏r was carried out the review did not give rise to any qualifications and in the past

investments were also made in the past financial year to maintain and optimise the group s production facilities including the installation of a new steam boiler in sk√¶lsk√∏r which has significantly reduced energy consumption the experience gathered from last year s investments in a new evaporation plant and co2 capture system is also positive co2 is now systematically captured and reused in denmark and germany and the energy savings can pay for the investment in the plants in just two years the logistics area also saw investments in optimisation measures based on an overall analysis of inventory management several changes were made to the warehouse facilities infrastructures during the financial year which led to improved eÔ¨Éciency and significant reductions in internal warehouse transport in the past year the energy ambassadors appointed at the production unit in sk√¶lsk√∏r have considered how operations and maintenance in production can be optimised this proved to be a success and many ideas for improvements and streamlining of processes and energy consumption were gathered and executed during the year in the coming year the group expects to implement an enterprise

practice the recruitment of new employees is mainly based on the candidates professional and personal qualifications matching the job description but harboe is also committed to ensuring that the

regardless of gender nationality religion or age when recruiting for positions at all group levels everyone with the right competencies and ambitions is encouraged to apply regardless of gender

qualifications have been identified harboe s staff and management policy aims to create the framework for a proper work-life balance harboe conducts annual performance interviews with managers and employees in the organisation with responsibility and personal career development as integrated elements harboe follows up on employee satisfaction in the organisation at appropriate intervals including on the satisfaction with the possibilities for personal professional and career development so when recruiting for positions at all levels in the group everyone with the right competencies and ambitions is encouraged to apply 75 of harboe s employees are employed in production process service and inventory which are traditionally predominated by men this also affects the ratio between men and women applying for positions and is reflected in the general number of men and women employed in the company at the end of the financial year 78 of employees are men as regards other positions in the group including management administration development sales and marketing the group employs 49 women and 51 men harboe s policy on the underrepresented gender at other management levels is an integral part of harboe s diversity policy the group s values and management practice integrate the fact that everyone regardless of gender and background with relevant management skills and development ambitions is invited to participate in training and to apply for management positions the group also offers housing assistance in the local area and general pay and employment conditions to make it attractive to work for the company and enables employees to have a healthy work/life balance the group has found that such conditions promote motivation for i.a female employees to apply for management positions in step with the continued internationalisation of the company and the strengthening of the development sales and marketing functions harboe has thus focused on further increasing diversity and this aim was reflected during the financial year with the employment of more women among international specialists and managers in accordance with the group s general diversity policy the aim is continued organisational development while at the same time strengthening diversity across harboes bryggeri and this will also be our aim for the year ahead target for women on the board of directors with a view to ensuring a more equal distribution of men and women on harboe s supreme governing body harboe s board of directors has fixed a target for one-third of the members of the board of directors to be women this target must be realised in connection with the company s annual general meeting in at the latest as part of the process of identifying new potential board members harboe makes a point of adding competencies relevant to fulfil the group s strategy emphasis is also placed on the board of directors being composed such that its members match each other in the best possible way in terms of experience age gender etc in order to ensure a competent and versatile contribution to har- boe s management this is an ongoing process and in the past year we also discussed the future composition of the board of directors on the current board of directors the board members elected by the general meeting still consist of five men and one woman the board of directors remained the same during the year in the period up to the board of directors will continue its discussions on its composition and decide how best to meet the target for the proportion of women organisation for strategy implementation focus is on strengthening and updating competencies at all levels in the group to place it in the strongest possible position to execute its international growth strategy this includes the continued development of the international sales organisation which was upgraded with new strong competencies targeted at the continued development of growth markets in asia and africa among others the ingredients activities were also strengthened further by specialists with solid technical know-how who could support the sales activities offering educated advice and develop tailored solutions during the financial year harboe continued its strategic management development programme which will form the basis for strengthened competencies and a shared frame of reference for the operational management of the group the programme also ensures the effective anchoring of the strategy processes among key managers in the group for example through an annual strategy seminar for the entire international corporate management team the operational part of the group also implemented a number of training activities during the year the team leader training programme which harboe set up in denmark a few years back with a view to ensuring effective and close fol- 3 csr 2015/16 low-up on quality and efficiency in the individual production processes was continued in the group s german production unit the programme yields positive results in the form of continuous optimisation and efficiency improvements in operations at the same time feedback indicates that the increased level of responsibility is a strong motivational factor for both the individual team leaders and the employees in the organisation who thus get more influence on operational decisions job satisfaction and excellent occupational health and safety the wellbeing health and general human rights of our employees including their right to organise and collective agreements are important issues to harboe the group offers i.a a healthy and diverse range of food in its cafeterias as well as personal advice and a range of activities aimed at healthy living these

as well as occupational health and safety during the financial year absence due to illness was 2 at harboes bryggeri and 6 and 7 respectively at the two subsidiaries the aim is to reduce absence due to illness in the group as a whole permanently to a maximum of 3 and targeted efforts will be made in the year ahead to ensure great occupational health conditions and strengthen the cultural and management values which may help us fulfil this aim in terms of occupational injuries during the year harboe also targeted its efforts at increasing safety even further throughout the value chain and set targets for the maximum number of annual occupational injuries for each production unit the aim for denmark and germany is a maximum of four annual occupational injuries and the maximum for estonia is two occupational injuries in denmark no occupational injuries were reported for the financial year whereas germany and estonia exceeded the number of injuries the group s production unit in sk√¶lsk√∏r has got occupational health and safety certification in accordance with ohsas 18000:2008 the result of which was very satisfactory with low levels of absence due to both injury and illness therefore the preparations for similar occupational health and safety certification for the group s production units in germany and estonia were initiated and are expected to be completed in 2017/2018

employees of jyske bank energy food for body and soul jyske bank 's policy is based on its values and views of food and meals it is the aim of the canteens in silkeborg that the group 's employees are offered tasty meals that are also nutritionally balanced and ensure that the individual employee can be up to speed as far as possible local danish produce in season is used and the canteen makes most things from scratch so it ensures the best knowledge of what each dish contains thus avoiding unnecessary additives since the canteens have focused its efforts to reduce food waste in all processes which has resulted in a reduction in the amount of produce used of about 7 these savings have also resulted in lower resource requirements as less waste means less energy consumption and the amount of waste has almost been halved over the period 6 in jyske bank removed the trays that were available to the users of the canteens as internal tests had demonstrated that food waste would be reduced by 5-10 when trays were not used an important side benefit from the removal of the trays is an improved work environment as it was possible to reduce the load to be lifted every day by two tonnes to reduce the noise from the clearing area and to reduce pressure on the dishwashing function the same applies to the environment in general as less dishwashing means less soap and chemicals used kitchen and waiting work is physically demanding and therefore the canteens make continuous efforts to do away with or minimise heavy lifting and bad working postures therefore all the canteen employees have participated in an ergonomics course helping them to choose correct work postures and to minimise lifting also in lifting trucks hand trucks were purchased to ensure that employees no longer have to lift heavy crates for instance with vegetables fruit and mineral water the last workstations in the kitchen without adjustable height functions have been replaced so now all workstations can be adjusted individually water glasses in the canteens have been replaced by polycarbonate plastic drinking glasses and in this way each time a glass tray is lifted the load is reduced by 4 kilogrammes which means that the daily lift load is reduced by 300-500 kg environment and energy jyske bank is aware of its responsibility for the environment and endeavours to establish a setting to ensure effective and careful employment of resources based on common sense the group relates on an on-going basis to energy consumption choice of materials and reduction of co2 emissions jyske bank attaches

basis installations and lighting in respect of useful life and energy consumption by focusing on integration of environmentally sound sources of energy in connection with construction projects jyske bank has replaced 2000 light bulbs with led lighting thanks to this initiative the group achieved savings of about 90,000 kwh a year corresponding to about dkk 180,000 also the replacement resulted in a reduction in the need for cooling by about 30,000 kwh corresponding to about dkk 60,000 moreover led lighting results in large savings in respect of co2 emissions due to the low power consumption 7 jyske bank makes sure that used office furniture and fittings are re-used by selling used office furniture and fittings to the company jk office which donates unsellable furniture and fittings to the

made international private-banking clients aware of the fact they are responsible for reporting their deposits returns etc to the tax authorities in their home countries jyske bank did not however check whether clients made such reporting in the group decided to strengthen its efforts in respect of tax transparency by in future solely to work with clients in connection with whom jyske bank either ensures that they declare their tax liabilities to the relevant tax authorities or that jyske bank takes care of the reporting to the tax authorities subsequently the group contacted the relevant clients to ask for documentation of tax transparency the clients who could not produce documentation of tax transparency were given the opportunity to initiate a declaration process in their home countries the group completed the project on 30 june and the clients were divided into three categories 1 `` green clients '' who had produced documentation or on whose behalf jyske bank reports their tax matters 2 `` amber clients '' for whom jyske bank knows positively that they have initiated declaration 3 `` red clients '' whom jyske bank can not get in touch with or who do not want to declare their tax liabilities this last group had their accounts and custody accounts blocked and can not make transactions involving these accounts.. if they want to have access to their funds they must inform jyske bank of which other bank they wish to have all their accounts transferred in the autumn of jyske bank compliance conducted a comprehensive review to examine whether this policy had

with other enterprises public authorities or players from civilian society we contribute the resources that we have available in the business and involve ourselves in a process that can contribute to improvement for individuals as well as local communities/society csr internally internally in the group we wish to promote diversity in the jyske bank group to the extent it is relevant involve us in the employees professional development and day-to-day job satisfaction involve employees in initiatives focusing on the business impact on the environment csr report page 3 clients advice to our clients is based on the legislation in force at any time including the rules on good advisory practices being a bank and a mortgage credit institution it is crucial for us to share responsibility with respect to our clients finances we do this through clear guidelines for our credit policy for both clients and guarantors and through advisory services that ensure a good overview for the clients of their possibilities and risks also we take such responsibility by checking that our clients do not use the bank for criminal purposes such as money laundering and tax evasion special advisory services for young clients unfortunately some young people end up having a history of bad credit the reason is that they have a poor understanding of their finances and act on impulse therefore they run a higher risk of accumulating large debts too early in life jyske bank launched therefore in a new advisory concept especially targeting clients between 18 and 27 years of age all branches have customized products and special advisers for this target group moreover jyske bank participates in various programmes to teach young people to be in control of their own finances in the bank introduced an app weekly that can help uses to gain an overview of their day-to-day finances assistance for home finances team bolighj√¶lp team financial assistance for housing at brfkredit will offer assistance when clients have lost the overview of their financial situation and are in arrears with their mortgage payments for instance due to divorce or unemployment the team makes great efforts in order to solve the problem in cooperation with the families for instance they help them to regain an overview of their financial situation and to enter into individual agreements on debt repayment also with other creditors since team bolighj√¶lp has been in contact with about 400 families and it has been successful in finding a solution for two thirds of the families by far most of them were given the possibility to stay in their homes but in a few cases it was necessary to sell the property at loss yet the family avoided a sale by order of the court money laundering jyske bank wishes in

a high professional level moreover new training material has been prepared for the employees tax evasion jyske bank has a clear policy not to contribute to tax evasion in the international units therefore decided to strengthen their efforts in respect of tax transparency by in future solely to work with clients in connection with whom jyske bank either ensures that they declare their tax liabilities to the relevant tax authorities or that jyske bank takes care of the reporting to the tax authorities the clients who could not produce documentation of tax transparency were given the opportunity to initiate a declaration process in their home countries the project was completed on 30 june clients who did not declare their tax liabilities had their accounts and custody accounts blocked they can only have access to their funds by transferring their accounts to another bank this project is in line with the group s work initiated in to implement fatca crs and stricter rules on money laundering in the autumn of jyske bank compliance conducted a comprehensive review to examine whether this policy had been embraced by the employees of the international units and whether client accounts had been blocked as outlined above the result was very positive and all reports were green in special focus was on compliance of the new rules on the prevention of money laundering and

chosen with care it is the aim of the canteens of the jyske bank group to serve the employees tasty meals that are also nutritionally balanced as far as possible local danish produce in season is used and the canteens make most things from scratch this ensures knowledge of the ingredients and makes it easier to avoid unnecessary additives since the canteens in silkeborg have focused their efforts to reduce food waste in all processes in the trays were removed in the canteen which was a successful initiative and in transparent buckets showing measurements for food waste were placed in the kitchen so the type and amount of food waste became visible in all bottled beverages were replaced by canned beverages and water glasses were replaced by polycarbonate plastic drinking glasses that can be reused this means that the heavy lift loads for the canteens employees are reduced and it has become easier and more environmentally friendly to transport and handle packaging materials and containers moreover all cans are recycled also those without a deposit at the beginning of the year the sideboard for guests and some worktops in the kitchen were replaced this ensured better work flows better cooling systems resulting in about 30 lower energy consumption less inappropriate lifting and less noise also all three canteens in silkeborg have now been equipped with the same kind of soap dispensers ensuring that the employees use the right products and doses in the canteen at brfkredit in lyngby entered into a cooperation scheme with daka refood which collects about 200 kg food

have been established in the individual branches also a dialogue-based workplace assessment is offered as an alternative to the traditional form-based workplace assessment the purpose is to involve employees actively in the improvement of their own working environment in as well as the danish working environment authority awarded the group green smileys at all inspections in the group s measures

a cardiovascular disease up to and including the 2015/2016 financial year matas has donated more than dkk 16.4 million to the danish heart foundation in the past financial year the donation amounted to dkk 1.9 million the amount came from fund-raising partly from a share of revenue from sales of matas's own-brand luxury plaisir skin care line moreover in the 2015/16 financial year matas offered club matas members to use points earned to pay for membership of the danish heart foundation according to the danish heart foundation 285,000 people in denmark unknowingly suffer from hypertension which if untreated can lead to cardiovascular diseases in collaboration with the heart foundation matas regularly offers free blood pressure testing in its stores in the 2015/16 financial year 122 matas stores participated and 3,344 people had their blood pressure measured in 9 of these people the measurements showed moderate to severe hypertension and the heart foundation consequently recommended that they consult their own doctor for follow-up examinations matas continued its close collaboration with the danish cancer society during the 2015/16 financial year with the aim of contributing to a decline in the number of people contracting skin cancer the most common type of cancer in denmark skin cancer can be prevented by following important sun advice from the cancer society matas and the danish cancer society collaborate closely to raise the awareness of this sun advice with a special focus on increasing people 's knowledge about how much sunscreen should be used and the minimum uv index at which protection is needed these messages are disseminated through matas 's various media on matas sun products and in particular in the individual advice provided to consumers by trained matas shop assistants in the stores the advisory skills of matas staff in this area are updated regularly by way of a supplementary training course developed by the danish cancer society in the financial year matas and the danish cancer society held a full-day event at 51 matas stores throughout denmark at which consumers were offered a free subcutaneous examination to detect any damage due to sun exposure and personal advice from representatives of the cancer society as stated in the group 's csr policy matas continually seeks to enter into partnerships with competent stakeholders regarding activities that could potentially make a positive difference to consumers health matas continued its collaboration with the danish lung association during the 2015/16 financial year this year attracting attention to the fact that many children and young people suffer from chronic pulmonary diseases as an example one in five children of nursery or kindergarten age suffer from asthma the same goes for one in ten children of school age and more than a thousand children and young people furthermore suffer from rare pulmonary diseases in the past financial year matas chose to donate half the revenue from the sale of matas christmas cards to the lung association s family camps for children suffering from pulmonary diseases and their families this resulted in a donation of more than dkk 50,000 additional information on the group 's collaborative activities is available at www.matas.dk/responsibility employee competencies the group 's intellectual capital is deemed to be essential for meeting the group 's growth strategy the goal is for professional advice in the stores under the motto good advice makes the difference to ensure that consumers make a qualified choice among various products both relative to their needs and relative to any special wishes with respect to the environmental profile of products moreover competent advice is to lead to continuing good customer experience thereby strengthening the group 's strong market position in the 2015/16 financial year the group had 2,163 full-time employees fte down from 2,226 last year in the 2014/2015 financial year matas continued its efforts to provide an excellent and attractive workplace where employee competencies and personal and professional development are in focus for this reason matas continues to invest in a structured training programme for all full-time matas shop assistants training and knowledge resources matas is the only retail chain that trains materialists and by far the majority of the chain 's staff are either currently undergoing training or are trained materialists the two-year training programme consists partly of an apprenticeship at a matas store and a training programme consisting of four modules correspondence school courses a course in otc medicine and a final test after completion of the programme materialists have the option to specialise matas store managers receive additional training in management coaching operations and accounting to ensure that they have the necessary tools to handle the day-to-day management of a store matas wants to continue to attract retain and develop committed employees with the skills to provide specialised service to customers for this reason skills enhancing programmes are prepared for each head office employee and each of the employees at every store in the chain at matas it is the knowledge and know-how of the employees which ensures that customers get the best advice from industry specialists this knowledge and know-how is constantly updated through supplementary training in health and beauty through courses which are to some extent offered by suppliers to a significant degree the group seeks to train its own managers with five levels of management training offered to materialists this management training helps improve and expand the skills of store managers their deputies and young talents skills that are key to the personal and professional development of materialists and to handling the strategic tasks and projects necessary to ensure the continuing success of the group matas

maintain a safe and healthy working environment for its employees matas contributes to diversity and an inclusive labour market through special employment plans such as part-time work schemes and a project called klap kreativ langsigtet arbejdsplanl√¶gning creative long-term work planning matas collaborates with the danish lev society on the klap project whose objective is to give people with special needs and learning difficulties an everyday situation in the form of a job with content and the opportunity to meet other people at the end of the financial year the group had 31 employees under the klap project the employee satisfaction survey shows a very good score of more than 4.2 out of 5 for the group as a whole matas recorded a minor 0.4 increase in the level of sickness absence but excluding the sickness absence that often accompanies a pregnancy and taking into account employees who resigned during the year the adjusted sickness absence rate was 2.2 which is low relative to peer companies sickness absence employee satisfaction under the heading of accountability matas's website contains further details on the group 's efforts in this respect this information is updated

relation to integrity fairness and corporate social responsibility we have integrated the un global compact 's ten principles relating to human rights labour rights the environment and good business ethics in our csr policy our csr policy consists of the following main elements business conduct human rights employee rights anti-corruption environment among other things the policy states that the group condemns bribery forced labour or child labour and does not tolerate any discrimination we handle csr issues in a manner that ensures that all employees in the group and suppliers are aware of our positions and guidelines we continuously ensure that our procedures and processes support the policy all standards are integrated in the internal systems of the business areas and subsidiaries and regular audits are conducted these also cover our partners in the following we will report on policies actions and results in the areas of health and safety which are part of labour rights and the environment in that connection we will also report on key aspects of these areas in the group we have positions on other csr issues for example in the areas of human rights and anticorruption for which we do not however carry out planning measurement and follow-up to the same extent for example we have a code of conduct for suppliers and we focus on training recruiting and developing the construction and civil engineering employees of the future our action in these areas is described in the business conduct section corporate social responsibility prevention of injuries we want to avoid occupational injuries among other things by promoting a culture that focuses on the health and safety of employees the mt h√∏jgaard group s statutory reporting on corporate social responsibility csr is set out below this puts us under an obligation to prevent injuries and work-related illness by ensuring that employees are trained and instructed to perform their work and that the right conditions are present to enable them to perform their tasks the group 's csr policy applies to all employees in the business areas and all wholly-owned companies each of the business areas and companies also has a number of independent policies based on the csr policy but drawn up in relation to the strategies specialist field and organisation of the specific business area or company as the various companies in the group are very different in size and structure they work independently with the areas to suit their needs as appropriate the work on the prevention of injuries takes place in the business areas or in each subsidiary actions results and objectives the business areas and subsidiaries continually strive to improve their health and safety initiatives 14 annual report management s review methods employed include visits and internal audits on construction sites health and safety are regularly mapped and systematic risk assessments of our activities in denmark europe and greenland are carried out actions results and objectives construction and building materials can have a wideranging impact on the environment therefore we have implemented a number of measures to reduce the impact on the environment across the group mt h√∏jgaard ajos enem√¶rke petersen and scandi byg have health and safety certification to ds/ohsas 18001:2008 in this connection the business areas and subsidiaries are audited by a certification agency twice a year in the danish market and once a year abroad lindpro is working to obtain certification in measures in included the installation of 253 new heat pumps to replace the traditional electric heaters in our site huts the total number of heat pumps is now up to 512 out of a total of 600 this has resulted in an electricity saving of over 50 per annum there is a group focus on individual injury frequencies and the business areas and subsidiaries have independent targets ajos has been replacing work pavilions with greener versions on a rolling basis in the company began using 85 new pavilions the new pavilions use approximately 50 less electricity for heating than the previous ones in the business areas set a joint target of achieving an injury frequency of less than 8 per one million hours worked and of reducing the number of lost time injuries time of 1-4 days by 10 in motion sensors were installed in all of construction 's and civil engineering 's site huts this produces an annual electricity saving of approximately 50 the target was not met as the injury frequency was 8.7 this is still one of the best results in the industry but it is not satisfactory as every injury is one too many the target of reducing lost time injuries of 1-4 days by 10 was achieved with a reduction of 17.5 partly as a result of focusing on the use of gangsupport the use of double-sided printing by scandi byg civil engineering and construction among others resulted in a 12 reduction in the use of paper in the group in equivalent to a saving of 1.6 million sheets of a4 paper despite the fact that revenue increased considerably the business areas consider that the frequency can be reduced further therefore civil engineering and construction will in future delegate action and responsibility to the local divisions to a greater extent rather than using the current centralised approach this will allow the divisions to work more on changing behaviour making even more progress in preventing injuries several other measures have been introduced within the group in recent years in the business areas these have included the introduction of a new company car policy and the reduction of electricity consumption in the offices for example via energy saving power strips and energy renovation lindpro has changed van supplier to reduce the company 's fuel consumption and co2 emissions scandi byg is in the process of changing its heating from natural gas to district heating in all production buildings moreover the business areas will focus on targeted induction of and communication to employees the preparation of instructions also for small tasks and the use of gangsupport they will also focus to a greater extent on assessment health and safety risks in the project planning across the group the opportunities for further energy efficiency are being considered continuously in the business areas expect to implement a new travel policy in order to reduce the number of overseas trips and to promote car sharing and electronic meetings among other things therefore construction and civil engineering continue to have an ambitious objective of reducing the injury frequency to less than 5 in the business areas by the end of and of reducing the number of lost time injuries of 1-4 days by a further 10 in 2012. business conduct code of conduct for suppliers in the group we are ambitious about our own conduct so we also set requirements for our suppliers when we make a group agreement with a supplier of building materials the supplier undertakes to comply with national legislation and regulations and meet specific requirements for quality health and safety and the environment to ensure that our standards are met the business areas and subsidiaries conduct inspection visits and audits or have them conducted by third-party auditors environment we want to take care of the environment in the group we want to ensure that our employees are always trained to perform their tasks in an environmentally sound manner in compliance with the existing rules we encourage the development and spread of technologies that promote environmentally sound solutions our environmental measures are based on the need to comply with environmental legislation in the countries in which the group has a presence and the environmental requirements made by our customers 15 annual report management s review in the event of non-compliance with the group 's standards we reserve the right to end the business partnership skills development as a large group we have a responsibility to contribute to as many people as possible receiving training we offer apprenticeships work experience and job rotation and the mt h√∏jgaard group now has just under 8 of its employees in training we want to increase this figure to 10 at the rate that is possible considering finances safety and the quality of the training courses offered we also focus on in-service training for example 12 local employees in greenland were offered further training to qualify them to take on more specialist more responsible jobs when the drilling season begins again next year over several years enem√¶rke petersen has supported an ambitious school project in the town of nkwenda in tanzania via danmission the project involves helping 12 local pupils help themselves by sponsoring their training in various trades such as bricklaying carpentry and joinery this secures local development and growth retention of older employees for many years enem√¶rke petersen has made an extra effort for older employees and has previously been awarded the danish ‚Äò senior praksis prize of the year for the company 's policy on older employees the purpose of the policy is to make it as attractive as possible for employees to continue their active working lives for as long as they want to for enem√¶rke petersen it means that the company retains solid experienced skills the activities carried out by the company include an annual conference for older employees an annual health check and subsidies for sport the result is that the younger employees can be trained up by more experienced employees to the benefit of the business and to avoid occupational injuries and attrition 16

prevention is carried out locally by the individual companies in the group actions results and objectives in we worked on improving the recording of incidents that in other circumstances might easily have led to an occupational injury but in which the employee was fortunate enough not to be injured near misses this allows us to take preventive measures to avoid similar incidents resulting in occupational injuries in future we keep a central record of such incidents and put preventive measures in place where possible at mt h√∏jgaard we focus on drawing up local action plans so that we can address local problems closer to the source and thus make our health and safety action more relevant to the individual divisions several of our subsidiaries are focusing on further developing their existing apv workplace assessment in mt h√∏jgaard had an injury frequency of 11.7 per one million hours worked this is an increase on when it was 8.7 in mt h√∏jgaard also had a target of reducing the number of lost time injuries involving 1-4 days absence by 10 we did not meet that target we will continue to pursue this target in as we focused mt h√∏jgaard s geographical footprint in and therefore have fewer activities abroad we expect a higher injury frequency in this is because the injury frequency has generally been lower on international activities than on our activities in denmark the

we are working to reduce environmental impact at our construction sites and offices as well as in the completed buildings construction building materials and the resulting waste have far-reaching consequences for the environment we therefore endeavour to formalise our work on ensuring consideration for the environment and reducing our environmental impact the companies in the group implement

green budgets and accounts scandi byg s prefabricated modular buildings save resources at all stages of the construction process in addition we use timber in the company as the loadbearing structure which releases a great deal less co2 into the environment than other materials at mt h√∏jgaard we advise on the options for sustainable building and refurbishment for example by using our energy calculations and green barometer and we also offer construction certified in accordance with breeam certification building research establishment environmental assessment method dgnb deutsche

office we actively participate in the steering committee of green building council denmark and in we made a number of presentations on sustainability and lifecycle costing at ajos we erected a further 150 cabins with heat pumps in and the same number with motion sensors this has resulted in an annual electricity saving of over 50 in the cabins that have been fitted with heat pumps ajos has also bought 2,000 strip-light fittings for construction site lighting copper-plated and with lowenergy t5 tubes which deliver an energy saving of 24 compared with older fittings or 19 kw per hour in the use of double-sided printing at among others scandi byg and mt h√∏jgaard resulted in a reduction of 4 in the consumption of ordinary a4 paper the reduction in was 11 at mt h√∏jgaard we intend to reduce the fuel consumption and co2 emissions from our company cars one way in which we are doing this is by evaluating the lifecycle costs of company cars so that maintenance and fuel consumption are included in the monthly performance that we use for the categorisation of cars that employees entitled to company cars can choose from in this meant that mt h√∏jgaard reduced fuel consumption per kilometre for company cars by about 2 as the average increase in mileage per litre was around 0.3 km per litre one of lindpro s targets is to achieve and document energy savings corresponding to at least 10 of energy consumption per employee in by the end of and to achieve and document a cut in co2 emissions corresponding to at least 20 of emissions per employee in by the end of achievement and documentation are proceeding to plan the whole group continuously focuses on the potential for further energy optimisation future employees we consider it important to ensure a qualified workforce for future construction and civil engineering assignments we therefore offer apprenticeships in various skilled trades employ rotation engineers and interns and focus on how we can be instrumental in helping young people on their way with training inside the industry in we had around 8 of employees engaged in training including those on apprenticeships and internships the success criterion is 10 in so far as this is possible in relation to the economics safety and quality of training courses offered in order to achieve this target enem√¶rke og petersen have collaboration agreements with

initiatives in injury prevention we continuously strive to improve our health and safety performance we will do our utmost to prevent injuries and work-related illness by instructing and training our employees to perform their work safely and without risks to health a great deal of the work on injury prevention is carried out locally by the individual companies where the activities that may involve a risk of injuries take place actions results and objectives injury prevention in we continued our efforts to improve recording and communication concerning near misses these are incidents that in less fortunate circumstances might easily have led to an occupational injury but in which the employee was fortunate enough to avoid injury the more we learn about the circumstances surrounding these incidents the better we become at preventing occupational injuries partly by improving communication with employees about risks in various work situations acquisition and recording of knowledge are therefore essential at mt h√∏jgaard we draw up local action plans so that we can address local problems closer to the source and make our health and safety action more relevant to the individual divisions in several of our subsidiaries we focus on further developing our existing apv workplace assessment in we worked on initiatives in areas such as fall accidents clearance and winter protection of building sites where the risk of injuries may be higher the companies have run campaigns held employee meetings and instructed employees in the importance of recording near misses in mt h√∏jgaard had an injury frequency of 27.4 per one million hours worked among our hourly paid employees this was higher than the expected target of an injury frequency of 15 for hourly paid employees and higher than when it was 11.7 the increase is primarily made up of less severe injuries the target is an injury frequency below 15 for hourly paid employees and this target must be achieved over the coming three years the increase reflected the fact that in mt h√∏jgaard did not pay enough attention to this area and specific initiatives will consequently be put in place in to turn this situation around going forward we will be working with a new joint figure for both hourly paid and salaried employees the figure was 14.9 in and the target for is 12 for all employees the injury frequency fell in three of the four whollyowned subsidiaries in in mt h√∏jgaard also had a target to reduce the number of lost time injuries involving 1-4 days absence by 10 unfortunately we did not meet that target we will continue to pursue this target in following lindpro s certification to the international occupational health and safety standard ds/ohsas 18001:2008 in mt h√∏jgaard and all the group s wholly-owned subsidiaries are now certified to this standard environment and climate the group wants to take care of the environment and the climate the construction process building materials and building waste as well as the operation of the finished building have wide-ranging effects on the environment and the climate the group s environmental initiatives are based on the legislation in the countries where we carry out projects however the initiatives also take account of special requirements from our customers and initiatives of our own that can help to reduce the environmental impact we are working on reducing the environmental impact in our offices on construction sites and in the projects we have completed we also encourage the development and spread of

employees are always trained to perform their tasks in an environmentally sound manner mt h√∏jgaard and lindpro comply with the principles in the international environmental standard ds/iso 14001:2004 actions results and objectives environment and climate the companies in the group implement a number of different activities that help to reduce the environmental and climate impact of our activities scandi byg s prefabricated modular buildings save resources at all stages of the construction process in addition the company uses timber for the load-bearing structure which saves the climate large quantities of co2 compared with other materials scandi byg wants to be at the leading edge of developments in the field of energy labelling and can meet the stricter requirements e.g low energy class and building class 2020 scandi byg also focuses on green procurement including for example swan-labelled eco-labelled products and timber from fsc/pefc-certified suppliers in we replaced all the light fittings at scandi byg s tolstrupvej premises in l√∏gst√∏r this resulted in a reduction in kwh consumption of about 70 per year we also set up noise attenuation for the exhaust system in we plan to continue the conversion of the heating system from natural gas to district heating in our office building as well as another production hall conversion in the other production halls was started in lindpro s objective was to be able to document a saving of at least 10 in energy consumption and reduce co2 emissions by at least 20 by the end of in relation to levels measured per employee lindpro currently estimates that the company has reduced its total energy consumption by the desired 10 in lindpro had an energy check electricity carried out on the buildings owned by the company in mt h√∏jgaard reduced its consumption of ordinary a4 paper by 21 the reduction in the previous year was 4 a considerable part of the reduction in must be put down to the lower level of activity and fewer employees in general we would like to reduce fuel consumption and co2 emissions from the group s vehicle fleet at mt h√∏jgaard we assess our company cars on lifecycle costs so the fuel consumption goes into the monthly performance which determines the categorisation of the vehicles in we fitted gps units in all works vehicles the gps units monitor the vehicles idling speed fuel consumption and driving characteristics using a built-in g meter so unnecessary fuel consumption can be avoided among other things this has meant that mt h√∏jgaard has reduced fuel consumption per kilometre driven in company vehicles by approximately 10 as the average increase in the number of kilometres driven per litre was around 1.5 km per litre ajos is also in the process of fitting gps units in its service vehicles both mt h√∏jgaard and ajos have rules for limiting idling enem√¶rke petersen have a vehicle policy with a minimum requirement for fuel consumption lindpro has opted for service vehicles with lower fuel consumption and in they introduced a speed limit of 120 km/h for yellow plate tax relieved vehicles both companies have an ongoing programme for replacing their vehicle fleets with more energy-efficient vehicles throughout the group there is also continual focus on opportunities for further energy optimisation one of these is the environmental and climate impact of the group s ‚Äò own activities the group also pays great attention to environmental sustainability in the services we supply to our customers lindpro carries out energy optimisation on existing buildings and offers consultancy services in this area when new buildings are being erected ajos focuses closely on energy optimisation in the building phase and advises on sustainability measures in connection with the layout and set-up of construction sites green budgets and accounts and offers customers the opportunity to have their energy consumption measured with a view to reducing for example co2 emissions ajos portable buildings consume very little energy and have been improved by intelligent energy consumption management e.g control of lighting heating ventilation and external awnings in collaboration with mt h√∏jgaard ajos has systematised sustainable measures to ensure that all major projects in denmark comply with mt h√∏jgaard s sustainability measures mt h√∏jgaard advises its business partners on

the green building council denmark and in we gave a number of presentations on sustainability and lifecycle costing in this and other contexts women in management in the group we do not discriminate on grounds of gender race or religion when recruiting training or promoting employees at board level a target has been set that a minimum of 33 of the members of the board of directors that are elected by the shareholders in general meeting should be women from and including the general meeting there are currently no women among the six board members elected at the general meeting and a target has been set that there should be a minimum of two externally elected women in at the same time we want to increase the proportion of women in management at other levels in the group by introducing a number of initiatives in the middle of the group introduced a policy on women in management which focuses on equal opportunities for all and endeavours to respect differences and promote a more equitable distribution of men and women at all levels we hope to achieve this by such means as recruitment career development and return-to-work discussions usually in connection with maternity leave from we expect to be able to measure the proportion of women in management across the whole group future workforce we consider it important to ensure we have a qualified workforce for future construction and civil engineering projects and to help young people to receive training and pursue careers in the industry we therefore offer apprenticeships in various skilled trades and employ rotation engineers and interns actions results and objectives future workforce in the group had 6.3 of employees in positions as apprentices interns and trainees we have a target of 10 at the rate at which this is possible to achieve this target we at mt h√∏jgaard will make a determined effort to raise the figure by one percentage point per annum in the coming years depending on the economics safety and quality of the training courses offered ajos works together with lindpro on accepting apprentices for limited periods with a view to providing them with the part of their practical training that ajos can offer enem√¶rke petersen has policies and initiatives to support the number of apprentices ‚Äò seniors and individuals with a need for job training among the ways of achieving this target enem√¶rke petersen has collaboration agreements with vocational colleges selected housing associations such as boligforeningen aarhus omegn and local authorities including the city of copenhagen to secure more apprentices in enem√¶rke petersen will continue to work on creating apprenticeships internships and job training places at the company s construction sites and offices and at their smedeland factory other csr initiatives in scandi byg donated a holiday cottage to the association familier med kr√¶ftramte b√∏rn families with children with cancer the cottage was fitted out in collaboration with the association and the topcamp henne strand campsite where it was then erected it was designed and produced at scandi byg s factory in l√∏gst√∏r enem√¶rke petersen is collaborating with a technical school in tanzania where the company pays for the training of 12 apprentices in carpentry and bricklaying new initiatives in motivation and principles for our csr work we in the group want to further develop our csr work as a natural essential and integral part of our operations and activities we therefore initiated a development project in which during is intended to lead to a revised strategy and a new csr policy which we expect to be able to report on in our annual report one of the objectives of a new csr strategy is to formalise in specific terms the group s position on those social issues on which we have significant influence and to endeavour to ensure that in future the group will be able to plan measure and follow up on these issues at the same level and using the same systems membership of un global compact the ten principles of the un global compact have been integrated into the group s csr policy since in view of this we see it as a natural step to formally join the global compact in the course of and accept the commitments this implies setting up gri reporting to consolidate the work of the group as a whole on environmental social and economic sustainability we would like to improve our knowledge documentation and reporting about the various areas corporate social responsibility is first and foremost a question of action but we anticipate that a broader data basis and more systematic documentation will give the group greater insight into and awareness of our impact on society data and documentation can be used for performance management in respect of our csr policy and can also make our efforts more visible to internal and external stakeholders as well as the general public we have chosen global reporting initiative gri for our reporting standard because it matches the group s requirements the standard covers most of the relevant areas with regard to sustainability it is a well-tested international standard which will give the group the chance to benchmark itself internationally against others inside and outside the industry in addition the organisation behind gri has developed a set of supplementary indicators for construction which will also form the basis of the reporting as a first step we in the group have identified a number of indicators covering environment and climate labour market conditions social factors and the construction industry more specifically which will form the basis of our csr reporting in the years to come work began in and by the end of we will map and develop the data basis internally with a view to being able to document and report our corporate social responsibility in relation to gri indicators in further development of the guidelines for suppliers and employees codes of conduct as part of the development project in we want to review and if necessary strengthen our guidelines for sustainable conduct which our suppliers employees and business partners must comply with as part of their collaboration with us the group already has a set of guidelines a code of conduct for suppliers which suppliers are expected to follow the guidelines for employee conduct/behaviour are currently covered by the general conditions of employment and personnel policies which all employees receive instruction on and have a duty to familiarise themselves with regularly and comply with in their day-to-day work while we are updating our csr policy there may also be a need to explain and clarify which of the csr guidelines employees employed by the group or by suppliers and other business partners must comply with in order to underpin the group s csr performance in their day-today work we therefore intend to draw up a separate code of conduct for employees which will be integrated into the general personnel policies an independent code of this type will help to make all employees aware of the group s overall objectives in the csr area whistleblowing procedure the group s board of directors has decided to implement a formal whistleblowing procedure throughout the group the procedure gives employees the opportunity to report wrongdoings or illegal practices such as fraud bribery or corruption within the group anonymously anonymity will ensure that an employee can report improper conduct without fear of reprisals this may be particularly relevant if the improper conduct involves the employee s superiors it is crucially important for us that a whistleblowing procedure should function in conjunction with not as a replacement for the group s other hr systems including close cooperation between employees and managers in the established joint committees the whistleblowing procedure will be covered by clear rules and transparency our whistleblowing procedure will follow a model in which employees or business partners reports of wrongdoings or breach of regulations will be made to an external third party in the form of an independent law firm that will scrupulously examine the report and thoroughly evaluate the facts and documentation of the case before passing them on to the group who will make a decision about possible consequences before the introduction of the procedure which is expected to be in mid-2014 we will therefore inform all employees business partners etc. about why the procedure is being brought in what it entails and how it can be applied implementation is currently awaiting approval by the danish data protection agency who will ensure that sensitive personal information is handled and stored in conformity with the legislation

162,NeuroSearch,ANN,2008,annual report environmental impact and ethics environment neurosearch does not currently issue separate environmental reports because its activities only have a limited impact on the environment neurosearch is aware of its potential external environmental impact and therefore continuously evaluates how various environmental factors can be improved with respect to preventing reducing or remedying damage to the environment the external environment the company does not yet have any actual industrial production so its discharge into the air soil and water is exceedingly limited in recent years neurosearch has focused on reducing its consumption of power and water in we expanded the head office in ballerup by 819 square meters of space including 32 new office workplaces the latest technologies were used to achieve energy-conscious solutions and control for lighting and heating in addition a completely new environmental yard of about 450 square meters has been added which meets all demands with respect to safety and correct handling of all types of waste handled in spite of this addition and the increase in the number of staff our power consumption declined with 3 compared to the level consumption of water was on a level with neurosearch uses natural gas to heat the head office in ballerup the gas consumption in increase by almost 2 year on year without degree-day adjustment at gothenburg a district heating system is used in which large amounts of waste heat from industrial or other processes we currently have a good working environment at neurosearch which it is my goal to maintain and develop so that our company appears as a modern and attractive place of employment is re-circulated into a network of heatpipes running through the city neurosearch uses small quantities of radioactive trace elements in certain laboratory experiments this radioactive material is stored and disposed of in compliance with the guidelines and instructions issued by the danish national institute of radiation protection the indoor environment we have a good working environment at neurosearch which we want to maintain and develop there is always room for improvement so we will constantly work to ensure that neurosearch will continue to be a safe and healthy workplace in terms of both the psychological and physical working environment neurosearch has always focused on working environment activities and in we decided to establish a dedicated working environment department in the years ahead working environment activities at neurosearch will be more structured and uniform in the organisation and we will work towards achieving a working environment certification level this will lead to efficiency improvements in our working environment activities including documentation while also ensuring that we can continue to work in the optimum manner in our day-to-day activities taking into account employee safety and health karina borup working environment supervisor at neurosearch 45 annual report neurosearch complies with all regulatory requirements with respect to animal experiments ensuring that they are performed in the most humane and appropriate manner ethics the regulatory authorities require that all new drugs are subject to extensive and lengthy studies before they can be marketed these studies include testing in animals and clinical trials in healthy humans and in patients another reason why these animal experiments are necessary is the need to understand disease mechanisms and the safety of potential new drugs before they are administered to humans neurosearch is in a close dialogue with the authorities on how to reduce the number of experiments and how to improve experiments conducted neurosearch also follows the regulatory rules closely with respect to storing of laboratory animals the latest initiatives include environmental enrichment which includes the layout of cages so that the animals can build nests clean themselves and have other natural behaviour external contract research organisations are carefully selected when safety experiments are to be made in animals before clinical studies are conducted with the company s drug candidates neurosearch only uses european organisations of good international repute that comply with all european standards on animal welfare and receive relevant inspections by the authorities as a relatively new initiative neurosearch has begun to use zebra fish as test organisms for instance it is possible to induce a condition in the larva of zebra fish which is similar to epileptic seizures and if a drug compound is added to the water it is possible to measure whether the compound inhibits the seizures and could thus be a new anti-epileptic drug so far zebra fish have only replaced a small part of the other laboratory animals that are normally used but it is possible that they can also be used as models for other diseases in future in this respect the genes of the fish can be mutated so that they can be used as a model for disorders such as alzheimer s disease 46 in fact using larva from zebra fish instead of rodents has great ethical and economic benefits the regulatory authorities especially the us health authorities the fda have shown interest in this new type of laboratory animals zebra fish could potentially be accepted as animal models for testing of new pharmaceuticals within a few years which could considerably reduce the number of other laboratory animals used neurosearch aims to respect a number of formulated international principles these principles concern ¬ö j^ kd 9edl dj_ed ed j^ h_ ^ji e\ j^ child concerning child labour ¬ö gkwb h_ ^ji wj meha m_j^ h if yj je gender race and religion ¬ö j^ h_ ^j

165,NeuroSearch,ANN,2011,csr was a year with considerable changes at neurosearch we have had to say goodbye to many highly appreciated employees and the company has been affected by important restructurings still we have continued our csr work both on a strategic level and in our daily work work environment at neurosearch work environment has high priority in all areas one of our crs objectives for was to implement a work environment management system in such a system was implemented to ensure systematic follow-up on employee health and job satisfaction as well as accidents and dangerous incidents by the end of a survey of the psychological work environment was carried out and it was followed up at the beginning of we have taken various initiatives to draw attention to our employees health and well-being free access to exercise room fresh fruit and locker rooms to encourage employees to exercise before during and after work we participate in the campaign we cycle to work in may of each year as well as in the yearly dhl relay race so far we have supported mobile blood donation together with our neighbour company struers but this activity was closed down by the end of in connection with the employee reduction in it was our aim to treat all discharged employees fairly and to give them a good and respectful compensation package in early neurosearch will participate in a regional health project together with other local companies dsb s-train four municipalities and the danish cyclists federation in order to identify neurosearch as a cycle friendly company this initiative is expected to further increase attention on healthy and environment friendly transport among our employees procurement policy in neurosearch prepared supplier guidelines based on the ten un global compact principles later we conducted an audit of one of our suppliers as part of an audit pilot project the un global compact principles have been communicated to our main suppliers in mutual contracts as well as in-house due to the restructuring of the company neurosearch expects an substantial decline in the number of direct suppliers in our procurement policy will be adjusted accordingly and subcontractors will be required to pass on the company s guidelines to their own suppliers animal welfare policy 28 neurosearch csr the aim for was to implement the principles of the danish ministry of justice regarding reduction refinement and replacement rrr in the daily work with animals the rrr work is described in the company s animal welfare policy and is currently debated in the project groups neurosearch requires that our suppliers of laboratory animals document valid iso 9001 accreditation or us assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international the objective for has been successfully implemented but in the future neurosearch will outsource animal testing as the company no longer has sufficient capacity to carry out animal testing consequently the objective for has been adjusted to the new circumstances and the objective is therefore an updated supplier contract in which neurosearch will require suppliers of animal tests to be in accordance with the rrr principles neurosearch intends to extend the rrp principles by adding other relevant conditions to the contracts environment and climate one of the objectives for was to reduce the company s co2 emissions in neurosearch moved from natural gas heating to district heating and we anticipate that this change will reduce our co2 emissions by 60 in compared to 60 per cent reduction in co2 emissions is expected in as neurosearch swapped from natural gas to district heating in the second half of an optimisation of our it infrastructure was not realised in due to cutbacks it equipment which is no longer in use in-house will be sold via a sales database and if it can not be sold it tools and equipment will be given away to relevant educational institutions in the future all cleaning detergents must be approved by the work environment manager in addition all cleaning detergents must be swan labelled nordic green label in neurosearch initiated an analysis process regarding the company s impact on the climate including co2 emissions and the results which are expected in the beginning of will form the basis of precise targets for knowledge management anti-corruption therefore we focus on knowledge management which we define as the part of the management process that involves procuring organising sharing developing and consolidating knowledge resources as part of our anti-corruption objectives for we have updated our standard contracts to ensure that our collaboration partners in business areas that are vulnerable to corruption commit themselves and their subcontractors to comply with our anti-corruption principles internally we have centralised our approval process for external consultants and other suppliers in business-critical areas including clinical studies and marketing in order to reduce the risk of corruption to further strengthen the anti-corruption efforts in neurosearch we will identify the critical areas within our business in and prepare our employees to handle critical situations correctly the corporate social report csr report is available in full at www.neurosearch.com/default aspx id=8300 knowledge

management via the monthly management report neurosearch is actively pursuing patents on the company s proprietary compounds and the neurosearch patent portfolio is constantly monitored and developed to ensure the best possible exploitation of the inherent value we also emphasise the need to publish peer reviewed articles in high impact journals as well as the need to present scientific results at relevant conferences in order to optimise the commercial as well as academic output from knowledge creation in neurosearch we have formed the publication strategy committee which oversees all such activities and contributes to optimal timing consistency and relevance of publications the committee makes all its decisions available to the organisation whereby the knowledge is diffused and anchored in the company knowledge management neurosearch work environment at neurosearch has high priority and we continually initiate steps to enhance the awareness of health among the employees 29

north media s subsidiary fk distribution has developed no ads+ allowing recipients of retail leaflets to choose exactly what printed matter they want to receive and what not to receive this has enabled the average no ads+ household to reduce its consumption of retail leaflets from 25 to an average of seven a week thus it is possible to reduce paper consumption by approx 70 per household fk distribution has also refined its digital platform minetilbud.dk via ios and android apps users can look for bargains while on the road and read the latest retail leaflets whether on a train or on their couch at home minetilbud.dk is seeing substantial growth and will in the long run also contribute to a greener distribution of retail leaflets results danes have embraced the new solutions consumers still want to read retail leaflets but the modern consumer also wants to shield the environment against unnecessary waste burdens and thusly takes a positive view on no ads+ and minetilbud.dk compared to no ads+ 70 of consumers today accepting all advertisements are interested in the solution which also receives positive response from an impressive 40 of current no thanks households consequently no ads+ has every possibility of becoming a green game changer in the danish distribution industry no ads+ has in a very short time gained wide backing from the retail trade this is because no ads+ consumers spend more time reading the individual leaflet opted for but also that no ads+ enables retailers to enhance their csr profile management commentary north media a/s

working conditions for the group 's distributors of newspapers and printed matter policy thanks to its distribution business north media is one of denmark s largest workplaces for young people working as a distributor is often the first source of money earned outside their home this places heavy demands on north media as a business and on the organisation systems and procedures to ensure that each of our employees has a positive and favourable perception of their first job tors receive a fair pay reflecting the work they do the distribution business has dedicated employees who regularly give instructions and check that north media meets the targets set results we believe that we help our young distributors develop basic skills such as organising one s time and planning an assignment by

skills that they will need to have when they begin their studies and later when they enter the job market as adults the distributors sense of responsibility is also underlined by the fact that they perform on the same level as our adult distributors health and safety in production policy the distribution business policy is to put conditions in place for a good working environment a low frequency of industrial injuries and sickness absenteeism for the packing terminals is a measure of success in that respect action the low frequency of sickness absenteeism is to be maintained on the basis of

as a result of this employees on long-term sick leave increase average absenteeism compared to sickness absenteeism has gone up and totals 6.0 days a year inclusive of employees on long-term sick

per employee integration of non-ethnic danes policy the company s staff policy is based on its strong core values which aim at providing equal opportunities to everybody and which require that as a rule everybody must meet the same demands action a requirement for being employed is that the candidate is able to speak and understand danish employees are also instructed to speak only danish at the workplace so that everyone can understand all conversations and no one feels left out in all production staff had their danish language skills tested and staff needing an update of their skills were offered training during working hours a project that has aroused interest by both media and politicians and resulted in a visit by the former minster of employment results this has led to the successful integration of those approximately 75 of the group s packaging staff who are non-ethnic danes as a result the supervisory positions are increasingly held by non-ethnic danes which in itself has a cumulative effect on successful integration in practice no conflicts seem to exist in the workplace despite the fact that people from different cultures work together at north media a/s policy

management commentary north media a/s sub-suppliers consumption of newsprint policy it is important for north media a/s that the group s newspapers are produced following sustainable methods this is why the s√∏ndagsavisen helsing√∏r dagblad and lokalavisen nordsj√¶lland newspapers have been using only fsccertified newsprint since late the fsc certificate is a global labelling system widely

group s newspapers pressens f√¶llesindk√∏b the procurement association of the danish press and the printing houses ensure that the requirements for the traceability of newsprint among others are met which is an important element of fsc certification the wood used to produce newsprint is from fsc-certified forests mainly nordic forests where trees are felled as new trees start to grow in addition the newsprint is produced from the residues from saw mills as well as recycled paper results most of the newsprint already used is collected and recycled through municipal recycling systems and is thus included in the production of new newsprint this helps reduce the environmental impact as much as possible eco-friendly distribution policy north media regularly explores avenues of more ecofriendly distribution arrangements and would in this context particularly underline no ads+ which holds the potential for revolutionising physical distribution in denmark and for creating a much greener and sustainable distribution arrangement action north media s subsidiary fk distribution has developed noads+ allowing recipients of retail leaflets to choose exactly what printed matter they want to receive and what not to receive this has led to a reduction in paper consumption by approximately 70 on average per noads+ household fk distribution has also refined its digital platform minetilbud.dk via ios and android apps users can look for bargains while on the road and read the latest retail leaflets whether on a train or on their couch at home minetilbud.dk is seeing

but the modern consumer also wants to shield the environment against unnecessary waste burdens and thusly takes a positive view on noads+ and minetilbud.dk at year-end the reduced volume of paper from noads+ has lowered the consumption of paper by 22,000 tonnes compared to the level before the introduction of this arrangement because of this co2 emissions have been reduced by approximately 50,000

further because 70 of consumers today accepting all advertisements are interested in the solution which also receives positive response from an impressive 40 of current no ads please households consequently noads+ has every possibility of becoming a green game changer in the danish distribution industry noads+ has in a very short time gained wide backing from the retail trade this is because

conduct we wish to take on this responsibility and be a credible partner to our customers and business connections as it contributes positively to the company s results and the wellbeing of our employees we have the following focus areas further development of our infrastructure projects to deal with environmental impacts this is done through product development and development of new improved product solutions with reduced environmental impact compared to previous solutions increased knowledge sharing with our customers through framework agreements with public sector companies this means that in collaboration with the customer we focus our efforts on method development appropriate plans for execution and specific customer preferences improved occupational health and safety to maintain satisfied employees which are capable of working fully responsibly with regard to safety and health in our opinion our efforts in connection with corporate social responsibility have provided good results to ensure a continuous development of our corporate social responsibility we wish to focus on the following areas over a period of three years environmental aspects in accordance with the aarsleff code of conduct we take environmental considerations during the design phase as well as during selection of methods below we have selected some activities to illustrate this in our pile production at centrum p√¶le a/s we have focused on minimising energy consumption since 2006 the highest energy consumption takes place in the production where an energy reduction of 30 has been obtained through production optimisation from 2000 to after three years of status quo with the level obtained in we have once again halved the energy consumption per cubic metre of concrete during the financial year e.g by installing insulated high-speed gates in our most used casting facility in the partnering framework agreement on no-dig renewal with the utility company aarhus vand a/s pipe technologies has set a target to reduce the co2 emission by 10 before the framework agreement runs from to which means that we must save an average of 25 tons of co2 per year in collaboration with the customer we have launched different initiatives relating to the planning of the assignments and methods for execution at the end of the calendar year we have saved 19 tons of co2 corresponding to 1.5 we continue to refine the production methods to minimise the environmental impacts both internally and with our subsuppliers and we expect to be able to continue reducing the co2 emission in the coming four years of the project period √∏stergaard a/s in vejle which was included in the aarsleff group in has a production method which is environmentally friendly by means of horizonal directional drilling and tunnelling methods we are able to establish water pipelines of very large dimensions without excavation this is beneficial to society in several ways firstly our trenchless methods cause very little inconvenience to the surroundings and secondly we contribute to upgrading the pipe system and solving the problems related to the discharge of increasing amounts of rainwater management s review 41 in connection with further development of drilling principles and drilling rigs √∏stergaard a/s has also worked on reducing the environmental impact an important measure is to reduce the amount of drilling mud which is to be disposed of previously the drilling mud was taken to a waste deposit now all dry matter such as stone soil and sand is separated as a result the drilling mud can most often be pumped directly from reception pit to recirculation plant and we are now transporting smaller amounts of drilling mud to the waste deposit and the consumption of fresh water for this production method has been reduced by 60 to 80 as most of the drilling mud is recirculated with contents of water our environmental policy comprises an objective of reducing the total environmental impact by minimising the consumption of fuel to focus on this objective the plant drivers of construction have completed a two-day fuel-saving course during the spring of more than 40 plant drivers attended the course and were instructed in economical efficient and fuel-saving operation of the machines we have benefitted by getting more specific ideas for fuel consumption reduction actual initiatives included installation of oil-fired burner in the machines as a standard reduction of idle-running periods reduction of revolutions as well as taskspecific selection of machinery and equipment all initiatives minimise the fuel consumption in order to benefit the most from the saving potential a behavioural change is vital it requires continuous follow-up but based on the received feedback we are indeed able to register behavioural change and savings however with no specific indication in litres we will continue following up on the cost-saving elements the results will show whether the effects can be further enhanced by extending the target group to the remaining plant drivers which are not permanently-employed drivers as well as include the other trade groups and supervisors a side benefit is that the course has strengthened the loyalty between the colleagues and contributed to increased exchange of experience among the plant drivers development of knowledge in interaction with the outside world according to our mission we want to possess the engineering and contracting qualifications of the future we also state that we are always looking for new simple and improved technical solutions preferably in collaboration with the customers below we have selected some activities to illustrate this we believe that one of our social tasks it to train young skilled building operatives and engineers we always have engineer trainees or newly qualified engineers on our international projects we consistently have about 20 building operative trainees enrolled in a training programme it may be young people who come directly from the primary and lower secondary school or are enrolled in vocational training or adults who are unskilled workers and wish to qualify as skilled building operatives in some of the framework agreements with the utility companies we employ engineer trainees as well as building operative trainees at the same time in the framework agreement with the utility company aarhus vand a/s we have focused on knowledge sharing with the customer and internally between the crews that are carrying out the work knowledge sharing takes place when the individual employees or the whole crew come up with improvement ideas which benefit the solution of the project and even make the work safer in management s review 42 terms of occupational health and safety the improvement ideas are reviewed in the crew prioritised in terms of effect and costs then they are registered in a common form called measures for improvements and the good ideas are shared among the crews many improvement ideas can be implemented quickly because they provide a significant effect and are not particularly expensive the current improvement activities mean that the customer in future will be better prepared for specifying execution requirements in future tender documents on our road project in tanzania where we train pupils in road safety we have participated in a road construction exhibition at our exhibition stand we showed the safety issues which are implemented in the project including road signing to avoid accidents and road safety education also we handed out flyers for both children and adults with illustrations showing how to avoid traffic accidents the local population visited the exhibition everyone was welcome and admission was free occupational health and safety according to our occupational health and safety policy we are committed to good planning and current improvements of the work below we have selected some activities to illustrate this we focus on occupational health and safety we wish that our employees work safely and that attrition in the workplace is prevented our goal is to reduce the number of accidents at work by preventing that accidents occur petri haugsted as 2003 wicotec a/s per aarsleff a/s and dan jord a/s all hold an occupational health and safety certificate the occupational health and safety certificate commits us to continuously improve the working environment and we strive to do so in many ways e.g in the above-mentioned framework agreement with aarhus vand a/s where many of the improvement initiatives are related to occupational health and safety generally this project is promoting the motivation to solving the workday assignments because everyone is heard and has a voice in the decision-making process of how to improve one s own working environment so far our efforts to prevent work accidents have resulted in a decreasing number of reportable accidents per million work hours and we are now below level compared to the average of the industry see graph another important focus area is planning of the work we strive to plan all our assignments thoroughly and make sure that we have considered every aspect before execution as a result the working environment is improved during execution in relation to the strain on the employee we are minimising attrition of the individual employee and we are avoiding quick fix solutions which often entail a risk of accidents a cable laying project in north jutland is an example of how we have developed a work method which minimises both attrition of our employees and the risk of accidents a special trench and cable laying box allow us to carry out the work with a minimum of heavy lifts less manual work and significantly reduced stay in the excavations and thus a reduced risk of accidents for our employees our employees on the project in close cooperation with our workshop and department for mechanical design are responsible for the development and the result is a tool which improves productivity as well as the working environment management s review

must comply with the values of the aarsleff group which are the fundamental principles of all our activities and actions in our opinion our efforts with corporate social responsibility have provided good results aarsleff s code of conduct applies to all the companies of the group aarsleff s code of conduct is the overall ethical set of rules applying to the group s activities the code of conduct is supported by the policies and guidelines of per aarsleff a/s e.g values of the aarsleff group investor relations policy policy on handling of inside information anti-corruption policy guidelines on compliance with competition law sponsorship contributions and donations for charity to ensure a continuous development of our corporate social responsibility we wish to focus on the areas below over a period of three years based on the overall policies and targets mentioned above environmental considerations and climate change adaptation applying to per aarsleff a/s we wish to support society s interest for improvements of the environment e.g by reducing energy consumption through the use of environmentally friendly methods one of our most important focus areas is to further develop our products and infrastructure projects to mitigate the negative effects of the long-term environmental impact e.g within wastewater handling and coastal and harbour protection an example of this is a sewer project near langelinie in odense carried out in a partnering agreement with the utility company vcs denmark here we must allow for future climate changes in a protected landscape we continuously find solutions to how we can observe the required considerations during the rehabilitation work the development of our execution methods and optimisation of our know-how take place in collaboration with vcs denmark an example of some of the results achieved during the financial year within development of production methods and materials is our led curing method for trenchless pipe renewal which applies led light for the curing of the aarsleff liner this method consumes considerably less energy in addition to the training which our plant drivers have completed with a view to reducing the fuel consumption and thus the co2 emission level we have also focused on minimising the fuel consumption by replacing old machines and purchasing new ones as a result we always choose the machines with the lowest environmental impact when there is a choice between several machines which all comply with the required machine specifications consequently during this financial year construction only bought machines with stage iiia and iiib engines which have reduced emission of exhaust gasses the policy summary of quality environmental and occupational health and safety management supports our work with this issue development of knowledge in interaction with the outside world applying to per aarsleff a/s we want to develop new simple and more cost-efficient solutions preferably in collaboration with the customers we wish to increase knowledge sharing with our customers management s review 25 through long-term working relationships resulting in joint development of know-how this means that in collaboration with the customer we focus our efforts on method development appropriate plans for execution and specific customer preferences to solutions an example of development of knowledge in collaboration with the outside world is the partnering framework agreement on no-dig renewal with the utility company aarhus water here pipe technologies works closely together with the client and at semi-annual workshops we analyse the energy consumption and plan the execution of the work in consideration of the co2 targets together with aarhus water we have set a target to reduce the co2 emission by 10 before the framework agreement runs from to which means that we must save an average of 25 tons of co2 per year in collaboration with the customer pipe technologies has launched different initiatives relating to the planning of the assignments and methods for execution in the calendar year we have saved 34 tons of co2 we believe that one of our social tasks is to train young people apprentices and trainees as well as skilled building operatives and engineers we wish to develop our collaboration with the educational institutions by increasing the number of traineeships and internships we prioritise special training of unskilled workers by means of targeted internal training courses primarily within the industrialised fields of activities as a specialised contractor within the civil engineering business we find this development of expertise just as important as the apprenticeships seen from a social perspective during the financial year we have had 61 apprentices and trainees we have an average of 20 new employees enrolled in our internal training course for unskilled workers each year in the coming financial year we will implement actions plans to increase the number of apprentices and trainees this implies setting targets in relation to the number of employees of the respective employee groups staff conditions working environment and safety applying to per aarsleff a/s aarsleff is certified according to the ohsas 18001 standard we wish to offer attractive workplaces where a value adding working environment job satisfaction and lifelong development are in focus a safe working environment has a higher priority than reasons of economy we do not accept accidents and we do not want to cause permanent injury to our employees neither because they have suffered an accident nor as a result of long-term physical or psychological impact the number of reportable accidents per million working hours is not satisfactory consequently we wish to focus even more on health and safety at work and we have revised our occupational health and safety policy and implemented a number of activities to support the policy the revised policy has been presented to and discussed with all managers and the implementation of the policy has been agreed on all managers are responsible that the policy is communicated to the staff of their respective divisions the revised occupational health and safety policy became effective on 1 october management training and targets for the underrepresented gender applying to per aarsleff a/s aarsleff s target is to continuously develop and strengthen all management levels of the company internal courses of development are carried out management s review 26 for current and prospective managers and combined with ongoing strengthening through recruitment during the past financial year 30 managers have carried out the internal management development course we have set up targets for the underrepresented gender in top management for the other management levels we have formulated a policy with the purpose of increasing the number of women in leadership positions our goal is that by the share of women in the board of directors of per aarsleff a/s is to constitute 25 of the shareholder-elected members the goal is based on four shareholder-elected members alternatively 20 if it is five members we will always ensure that the requirements to qualifications for board members are the same regardless of gender and that board members are elected on the basis of the qualifications required the share of the underrepresented gender in the board of directors is 0 at 30 september we have formulated a policy for the other management levels in per aarsleff a/s with a view to increasing the share of the underrepresented gender the policy is that we wish to have an open and unbiased culture that allows the individual employee to use his/her qualifications in the best possible way regardless of gender the purpose of this policy is to contribute to increasing the total potential for women in management in the business per aarsleff a/s operates in a male-dominated business culture this is significantly reflected in the number of male and female employees at all levels of the organisation

accordance with the values of the aarsleff group which are the fundamental principles of all our activities and actions in our opinion our efforts within corporate social responsibility have provided good results aarsleff s code of conduct applies to all the companies of the group aarsleff s code of conduct available at www.aarsleff.com is the overall ethical set of rules applying to the group s activities and comprises among other things environmental responsibility when we produce and contribute to environmental improvements contributions to establishment of sustainable energy solutions and climate adaptation requirements to comply with the internationally recognised human rights including ethical rules concerning child labour requirements to provide a safe and healthy working environment a basic requirement that we always operate within the framework of the law and international conventions that we always act in accordance with current competition laws and that we do not give or accept bribery in any form that we have the same requirements as described in code of conduct to our business partners and suppliers as a minimum aarsleff is thus aware that the company s activities are carried out with respect for basic human rights applying to employees and suppliers requirements to comply with human rights and the prohibition of child labour form part of our decision to submit tenders and must be complied with during the implementation of our activities the code of conduct is further supported by the policies and guidelines of per aarsleff a/s e.g the values of the aarsleff group which were prepared and revised in the financial year and communicated in a new form at the end of investor relations policy handling of inside information anti-corruption policy guidelines on compliance with competition law sponsorship contributions and donations for charity to ensure a continuous development of our corporate social responsibility we wish to focus on the below-mentioned areas in future years based on the overall policies and targets mentioned above environmental improvements applying to per aarsleff a/s we wish to support society s interest for environmental improvements e.g by reducing energy consumption through the use of environmentally friendly methods and materials in the financial year we have commenced the work on models of calculation for co2 savings potential by choosing alternatives within materials methods procedures and equipment in connection with the execution of sewer work the first versions of the operational calculation models are now available and used for trenchless sewer renewal in pipe technologies and for traditional sewer work in construction the models are expected to be further developed in the future financial year by calculations on specific projects in collaboration with customers management s review 27 pipe technologies has chosen to replace the generators with lithium batteries in all new cctv vehicles in addition to saving fuel for the operation of the generator the noise has disappeared in the financial year pipe technologies has installed lithium batteries in two cctv vehicles and two installation units and by the end of the financial year pipe technologies has a total of seven units with minimum energy consumption in the financial year we have installed solar cells on two site huts on a test basis construction has planned that all its drivers of vans and passenger cars must complete a course in eco-friendly driving this is done with a view to reducing fuel consumption and the consequent co2 impact construction has also decided to become certified in accordance with ds/en iso 14001:2004 the aim is to become environmentally certified by the end of the policy summary of quality environmental and occupational health and safety management supports our work with this issue in our opinion our efforts within environmental improvements have provided good results and we will continue our activities climate adaptations applying to per aarsleff a/s one of our most important focus areas is to continue developing our products and infrastructure projects to mitigate the negative effects of long-term environmental impacts e.g within wastewater handling and coastal and harbour protection we want to be an active co-player when projects of benefit to the environment are carried out an example of this is a south jutland-based biogas plant which will become the largest in northern europe in collaboration with the customer and the customer s consultant the project is commenced by a design phase which is expected to be followed by a contract for execution the plant is constructed for optimum utilisation of raw materials the energy extraction rate will be high and the residual product is odour-free and can be spread directly on the fields the aarsleff group has the expertise for the entire building process from site development to the installation of process equipment in our opinion the implementation of a number of projects has contributed to sustainable climate adaptation solutions and we will continue our activities development of knowledge in interaction with the outside world applying to per aarsleff a/s development of new simple and more cost-efficient solutions preferably in collaboration with our customers is also one of our focus areas increased knowledge sharing with our customers takes place through long-term working relationships resulting in joint development of know-how in collaboration with our customers we focus on method development appropriate plans for execution and specific customer preferences to solutions the framework agreement on no-dig renewal with the utility company aarhus water is an example of development of knowledge in interaction with the outside world there is a close collaboration between pipe technologies and the client on the project at semi-annual workshops we analyse the energy consumption and plan the execution of the work in consideration of the co2 targets together with aarhus water we have set a target to reduce the co2 emission by 10 before the framework agreement runs from to which means that we must save an average of 25 tons of co2 per year in collaboration with aarhus water pipe technologies has launched different initiatives relating to the planning of the assignments and methods for execution in the calendar year we saved 38 tons of co2 another example is a project in br√∏ndby where we carried out a rainwater reservoir extension from the beginning the customer planned to carry out the extension in the same way as the former rainwater reservoir i.e by a traditional construction of subbase gravel and base course gravel with drainage and well with pumps for water management s review 28 drainage however during the planning and design phase we suggested other solutions to the customer one of them was to establish the bottom of the reservoir by means of the lime stabilisation method this meant that drainage and pumps could be left out of the project and thus also the future maintenance of these it turned out that there was 5,000 tons of contaminated soil of class 2 and 3 in the area which we were able to incorporate on site as a result we avoided the environmental impact involved in the transportation of the soil for deposit during the project we exchanged knowledge with the client the consultant and the collaboration partners the construction work was carried out in half the time which meant that the reservoir was taken into use six months earlier than planned in our opinion a number of cooperative relationships with customers have contributed to the development of new simple improved and more cost-efficient solutions the activities continue training applying to per aarsleff a/s we believe that one of our social responsibilities is to train young people apprentices and trainees as well as skilled building operatives and engineers we wish to develop our collaboration with the educational institutions by increasing the number of traineeships and internships our training responsibility also comprises special training of unskilled workers this involves holding targeted internal courses primarily within the industrialised fields of activities e.g pipe technologies as a specialised contractor within the civil engineering business we find this special training just as important as the apprenticeships seen from a social perspective during the financial year we have had 65 apprentices and 32 trainees 55 workers were enrolled in internal special training for unskilled workers in pipe technologies we have set up targets for the number of employees from the following three employee groups which are being trained in the company apprentices 10 our basis is this financial year with an average of 65 apprentices this corresponds to 7 of the hourly paid employees trainees 5 our basis is this financial year with an average of 32 trainees this corresponds to 4 of the salaried employees internal special training of unskilled workers 6 our basis is this financial year with an average of 55 unskilled workers enrolled in internal special training this corresponds to 6 of the hourly paid employees meaning that we have reached the desired level which must be maintained in our opinion we have obtained good results and we will launch plans of action to achieve and maintain the targets the policies policy for apprentices and policy for trainees support our work with the above staff conditions working environment and safety applying to per aarsleff a/s aarsleff is certified according to ohsas 18001 we wish that our working environment is characterised by the following we are the best in the business within occupational health and safety and a safe working environment has a higher priority than reasons of economy in continuation of our occupational health and safety strategy which was implemented at the beginning of the year we have launched an internal campaign among other things the campaign comprises a training plan which ensures that all employees at all levels of the company will be trained in occupational health and safety in this current financial year we have carried out the following courses with the mentioned number of participants introduction to health and safety 345 employees primarily hourly paid employees health and safety for foremen 52 employees management s review 28 health and safety for ohs site representatives 37 employees health and safety for managers in the production as well as in the office area 135 employees as it appears from the graph on this page we are well underway with our occupational health and safety targets in so far as concerns the accident rate the number of reported near-miss incidents is increasing we consider this a positive sign because it allows us to prevent accidents our sickness absence rate which is exclusive of sickness absence for employees subject to a statutory danish agreement on refunding of sickness benefits in connection with prolonged or chronic diseases etc. absence due to accidents child s first day of illness and maternity leave is satisfactorily low and below our target of 2.5 in this current financial year the figure was 2.1 we wish to maintain a low sickness absence so we

193,Per Aarsleff Holding,CSR,2015,"1/3 corporate social responsibility per aarsleff s corporate social responsibility policy is based on operating a sound and financially responsible business to create job satisfaction growth results and progress we are aware that we are an integrated part of society and we wish to always comply with current norms requirements rules and legislation regardless of where in the world we operate we respect our surroundings and our ambition is to provide continued efficiency improvements of our services the principle elements of our corporate social responsibility are the aarsleff group s mission vision and values as well as our code of conduct in the financial year 2015/2016 we have extended our work with per aarsleff a/s 's corporate social responsibility in a number of areas so the results have not yet been reported for the financial year 2014/2015 the reporting of efforts and results will thus only relate to human rights environmental conditions and responsible social development fair business practices we want to contribute to a sound democratic and competitive development of society in denmark and abroad we do not allow any kind of price cooperation cartel formation or abuse of market dominance we always act in accordance with current competition laws and we do not give or accept bribery in any form in the financial year 2015/2016 we will provide training to relevant employees to make sure they understand and comply with current competition laws in the management team participated in an internal seminar on competition law human rights we always carry out our projects with respect for basic human rights requirements to comply with human rights and the prohibition of child labour form part of our decision to submit tenders and must be complied with during the implementation of our projects we can affect compliance with human rights by training our employees because their quality of life and development opportunities are important to the individual employee and to the company s development so we will focus our efforts on this area we will encourage our employees to develop their professional and personal qualifications by focusing on lifelong learning in the financial year 2015/2016 we will implement a pilot project providing danish language training to employees with reading and writing disabilities in the financial year 2014/2015 we have made an effort to ensure good working terms and conditions for all danish and foreign temporary employees hired via temporary employment agencies in particular we have made a careful selection of suppliers and have followed up on the suppliers and the employment conditions of their temporary employees environmental conditions we wish to support society s interest for environmental improvements e.g by reducing energy consumption and using environmentally friendly methods and materials and by reducing waste on our construction projects one of our most important focus areas is to continue developing our products and infrastructure projects to mitigate the negative effects of global warming e.g within wastewater handling and coastal and harbour protection we are implementing the environmental system iso 14001 and we expect to be awarded our environmental certification for per aarsleff a/s by the end of with energy saving efforts we can help ensure a better environment and reduce the negative impact on our climate so we will focus on the following environmental and energy saving efforts in the financial year 2015/2016 we will increase our focus on energy-saving and environmentally friendly company cars we will only acquire company cars with energy mark a+++ to a cars and energy mark a+ to d vans we will whenever possible install an idle-stop system on all old and newly acquired lorries we expect that this initiative will reduce co2 emissions significantly in the financial year 2014/2015 when we carried out the framework agreement on no-dig renewal with the utility company aarhus water we expected to reduce co2 emissions of relining work by 2 per year and 10 throughout the entire execution period from to we have achieved this target labour conditions we wish to be the best in the business within occupational health and safety and we wish to assign high priority to a safe and value-adding working environment we are certified according to ohsas 18001 and we continuously focus on improving our working environment corporate social responsibility 2014/2015 2/3 we aim at zero accidents and an

aarsleff a/s is quality certified according to iso 9001 by the end of the financial year 2015/2016 responsible social development based on a priority of stakeholders we have decided to initiate action plans on the following areas training of apprentices action plan 1 planned traineeships for engineering students action plan 2 action plan 1 we are committed to train apprentices in our opinion the training of apprentices is one our most important corporate social responsibilities the foundation of our success is that our employees have a high professional level and that they constantly develop it is a natural part of our operations to train apprentices and it is also a natural part of our corporate social responsibility to share and pass on our expertise and know-how our target is that the number of apprentices must account for at least 10 of our hourly-paid workers financial year 2014/2015 2013/2014 apprentices 77 65 share in 7.9 7 for the next financial year we have implemented the following initiatives some of the departments of per aarsleff a/s and some of the companies of the aarsleff group can not fully meet the training requirements of the apprentice training programmes set by the education committees our target is to establish apprentice training programmes across departments and companies of the aarsleff group allowing us to provide apprenticeships that meet the training requirements in full develop closer dialogue with educational institutions action plan 2 we have engineer trainees we wish to attract maintain and develop the best employees within the engineering disciplines we can achieve this by means of planned traineeships we see it as part of our corporate social responsibility to participate actively in the training of employees for the technical disciplines this way we ensure that the construction and civil engineering business has the right qualifications also in the future our target is that the number of trainees must account for at least 5 of our salaried employees financial year 2014/2015 2013/2014 trainees 54 32 corporate social responsibility 2014/2015 share in 7.2 4 3/3 we have achieved our target but to maintain our good

recruitment and jobs fairs develop closer dialogue with educational institutions the underrepresented gender this statement of the underrepresented gender is the statutory statement for the financial year 2014/2015 prepared according to section 99b of the danish financial statements act we have set up targets for the underrepresented gender in top management for the other management levels we have formulated a policy with the purpose of increasing the number of women in leadership positions our target is that by the share of women in the board of directors of per aarsleff a/s is to constitute 25 of the shareholder-elected members the target is based on four shareholder-elected members alternatively 20 if it is five members we will always ensure that the requirements to qualifications for

because governments have realised the urgent need for action especially in the eu which is the rockwool group s largest market a growing number of countries are competing to become the most energy efficient this is not just a short-term whim many goals and actions also involve the period up to 2020 better insulation is a key instrument more power plants or less waste of expensive energy better energy and co2 efficiency of buildings and industrial processes holds enormous economic potential a power plant using fossil fuels in cheshire u.k global reports llc annual report 19 energy a growing challenge energy has become a top political priority oil prices have more than tripled since early 2003 but demand especially in the developing world continues to grow concerns over security of energy supply are strong non-renewable energy sources still account for 87 of the world s energy consumption the dependence on energy imports is high and growing in most oecd countries the european gas crisis in 2006 accentuated the risk most of the world s natural gas reserves are controlled by just three countries four countries control the majority of the oil reserves the growing concern over global warming intensifies the political pressure to curb excessive waste of fossil fuels the eu has made a unilateral commitment to cut co2 emissions by 20 but aims at a multilateral target of 30 by 2020 there is still a chance to limit the increase in average global temperatures to ‚Äò just 2Àöc however according to the un climate panel ipcc this will require a 50-85 cut in the world s co2 emissions by 2050 the lowest hanging fruit insulation politicians are increasingly becoming aware that buildings are the most obvious place to start buildings account for some 40 of energy and end-use co2 emissions in the eu and the us heating and cooling are the major energy guzzlers in society a growing number of recent reports for instance from the ipcc ecofys stern vattenfall/mckinsey and ceps point to the fact that better energy efficiency in buildings and insulation in particular is one if not the most cost-effective measure to reduce energy waste and co2 emissions energy consumption for heating can be halved in a profitable way with current energy solutions it will improve and not compromise our quality of life if all buildings undergoing modernisation were to be brought up to contemporary energy standards we could in europe alone over time save ‚Ç¨ 270 billion in annual energy costs and we would save 460 million tonnes of co2 more than the eu kyoto protocol commitment on a world-wide basis vattenfall estimates that annual co2 emission savings of up to 3,700 million tonnes would be possible and profitable in buildings alone eu actions that matter the race for energy efficiency is clearly evident in the eu 25 tightenings of the energy requirements for new buildings are not unusual when the 27 member states and associated countries implement the energy performance of buildings directive 2002/91/ec abbreviated epbd now the energy requirements must be reviewed at regular intervals which should not be longer than every five years the effect of the epbd is only slowly starting to work in a growing number of ambitious medium-term goals were set passive house standards are planned for new homes in the uk norway and austria 2015/2020 and very low energy standards in france germany the netherlands and denmark a passive house is extremely well insulated and uses up to 90 less energy for heating and cooling than an average building as the next step the uk aims to introduce zerocarbon houses by by 2020 french buildings must produce more energy than they consume and in germany new buildings should be heated without the use of fossil fuels wherever possible global reports llc 20 annual report further improvements are expected the eu considers following the example of countries like germany norway and denmark demanding that all buildings and not just those larger than 1,000 m2 be brought up to contemporary energy standards when they undergo major renovations this is important as existing buildings hold the greatest potential for economic energy savings the eu energy end-use efficiency and energy services directive 2006/32/ec will provide another energy efficiency boost in the same magnitude as the epbd from and nine years ahead the member states must save at least 9 on final energy the member states shall for instance require energy providers to support their endusers in implementing energy efficiency improvements again some countries want to excel at national level the uk the netherlands germany spain and france are the most ambitious aiming to save at least twice the minimum requirement according to their now mandatory national energy efficiency action plans tangible goals have been set in for instance the netherlands to retrofit and improve energy efficiency by at least 30 in 200-300,000 buildings per year the target for france is 400,000 old dwellings per year whereas the uk aspires to double saving targets and increase subsidies from 2009‚Äì2011 the next big energy efficiency booster will be the eu action plan for energy efficiency aiming at saving 20 of primary energy before 2020 energy savings in buildings is one of the key areas the action plan must pave the way for improvements in information and financing support tax credits vat differentiation etc for energy efficiency in the member states it aims to introduce minimum energy efficiency requirements for both new and renovated buildings passive houses/very low-energy houses and energy-efficient modernisation should become the rule rather than the exception the rockwool group expects this action plan to increase the insulation market especially from but the exact scope will depend on the specific implementation in individual member states the ambitious energy efficiency race represents a promising opportunity for the insulation industry but it also entails a huge challenge for the authorities and the building industry that need to train millions of building professionals in new tight construction techniques correct installation methods are essential for optimal efficiency gains and for a healthy indoor climate energy efficiency outside the eu energy requirements are also being improved outside the eu in canada

one of the most profitable co2 abatement technologies this is crucial especially in times of financial crisis when governments are preparing legislation which will give cost-efficient green tech jobs while at the same time reducing their dependence on expensive and vulnerable energy imports the race for energy efficiency in buildings is now being expanded to the most important area the existing building stock better buildings are essential buildings are key to tackling the challenges of climate change security of energy supply and energy costs which continue to place an unnecessary heavy burden on our strained economy buildings account for some 40 of energy and end-use co2 emissions in the eu and the us but it does not need to be like this today it is possible to make buildings that are so well-insulated energy-efficient and comfortable that by adding a solar panel or other means of renewable energy it is feasible to have new buildings that supply more energy to the grid than they consume within our large existing building stock we can reduce the excessive waste of fossil fuel by up to 90 from hot air to real commitments among many good measures insulation is one of the most profitable co2 abatement technologies and this is increasingly being noted by governments and opinion leaders even in countries that are concerned whether they can afford co2 reduction commitments better insulation is a measure that society can not afford to ignore the less so in the present economic crisis approx 25 the recast directive which is expected to be finally approved in undertakes to tap the largest potential for better insulation the existing building stock making buildings more energy efficient also has very positive employment benefits according to the eu commission a recast directive will enable 280-450,000 potential new jobs by 2020 for these obvious reasons the eu commission no longer wants only buildings larger than 1,000 square metres to be obliged to energy efficient modernisation it should cover all buildings the commission will also require all member states to plan for very low energy standards e.g passive house standards for both new and refurbished buildings the first countries will require passive house standards for new homes within just four years but no country has so far made a plan for renovation to very low energy standards who will be the first examples of countries that will require standards for new homes the eu covering more than 60 of rockwool insulation sales has confirmed its commitment to improve energy efficiency by 20 by 2020 better buildings are key to achieving its goal of a 20 cut in co2 emissions before the end of the next decade this target will be raised to 30 if an ambitious international

minimises both our environmental impacts and expenses and a good and safe working environment contributes towards ensuring committed staff the environmental year at royal unibrew the year marks the end of our existing mach ii strategic plan a plan which since being introduced in 2005 has had material impact on the environmental work at royal unibrew environmental and health safety issues are thus part of royal unibrew s kpi key performance indicators reporting growth cost adjustments and production reorganisation have consequences with respect to our environmental impacts the changes will have negative environmental consequences to some production units whereas for other breweries they will affect environmental ratios positively during the year 4 new breweries were included in the group lomza in poland and st. vincent antigua and dominica in the caribbean furthermore we entered into an agreement with heineken for licence brewing in denmark however was also the year in which it was decided to close down the breweries in maribo denmark and lielvarde in latvia in all royal unibrew production units have strong focus on the environmental impacts of our production which is reflected in a strong commitment to environmental and health safety work in our efforts were targeted at reduction  of  energy  consumption reduction  of  water  consumption reduction  of  waste  water  discharge reduction  of  accidents  at  work changes to both production mix the number of breweries and calculation method have affected the data basis for example data are not available for the new breweries for all of and the st. vincent brewery is included in the reporting only as of for the royal unibrew group as a whole energy consumption per unit produced went up slightly by just below 2 from 2006 in spite of strong focus on energy savings at all breweries the primary reason was production reorganisation but also high energy consumption at the breweries in the caribbean water consumption per unit produced went up by 7.6 for the group as a whole from last year when water consumption was generally low but the increase was also due to higher water consumption at the breweries in the caribbean as compared to the rest of the group waste water discharge for the group increased by some 3 from last year due to the increased water consumption in the number of accidents at work and thus the accident frequency for the group as a whole went up by 8 the accident frequency is an indicator of health safety which will be closely monitored in future years in the initiatives taken to reduce the accident frequency will be intensified at our foreign breweries safety and health promoting initiatives have been taken this year which will be followed up in for example training of both management and employees in health safety issues has been planned at our breweries in poland and lithuania as regards the danish breweries the results for the year are characterised by production reorganisation and changed product mix this has generally resulted in environmental targets for the year not being achieved at ceres albani faxe or maribo bryghus projects have been launched that will contribute towards improving the results for both energy and water consumption in at kalnapilis production reorganisation also resulted in increased resource consumption and emissions as the basis of a future project on recycling of co2 the brewery is registering co2 emission from the process health safety and accidents at work are areas of strong focus and as of next year a number of targets have been established for these areas in particular in extensive mapping of indoor noise influencing employees was made and an action plan was prepared for reduction of the noise level due to increased production in latvia in consumption of electricity heat water consumables and raw materials has increased resulting in increased waste water discharge and emissions waste is sorted to achieve the highest possible recycling rate several optimisation projects have been launched to reduce energy consumption furthermore at cido a wpa work place assessment was carried out in the breweries in poland have achieved good results in the environmental area since 2006 environmental impacts declined in due to improvement projects resulting in reduction of both water and energy consumption for example at the brok brewery a project on recycling of hot water in the process was realised and the cooling requirements at strzelec were reduced following optimisation of the area usage further measures to improve environmental efforts have been planned for the future years as of the antigua and domenica breweries have reported environmental and health safety kpis whereas the st. vincent brewery did not start reporting until in the course of consequently it will not be possible to assess developments in the caribbean until in efforts are still directed at reducing the indirect environmental impacts from royal unibrew s activities consequently reduction of packaging volumes has resulted in a reduction of more than 200 tons of packaging in targets for over the next years a new common policy and objectives for the entire group will be prepared aimed at reduction of energy and water consumption health safety will also be a high priority action area we are also in directing targeted efforts at reducing our indirect environmental impacts in areas such as the development of lighter packaging and container types for bottles and distribution at an overall level the environmental impacts from the main activities of royal unibrew may be divided into direct and indirect environmental impacts energy and water packing glass plastic aluminium cardboard and paper vegetable raw materials malt barely lye naoh cleaning of processing plant all royal unibrew breweries discharge waste water containing organic matter by far the major part of the waste generated by us is recycled for various purposes thus only a very small part has to be incinerated deposited in landfills or destroyed as the breweries are situated in urban areas noise is a significant environmental issue internally particularly the prevention of unfortunate occurrences and accidents and work place assessments are high-priority target areas indirect environmental impacts particularly the following impacts have been given high priority selection of packaging and container materials the weight on non-returnable containers the use of non non-returnable containers for export environmental impacts from distribution through open dialogue with its suppliers royal unibrew works continuously to reduce its environmental impacts from the above factors additional information and documentation on

impact to establish safe and good working conditions for our employees and to supply consumers with products of a very high quality therefore our csr work is an integrated part of our business and a natural part of our day-to-day work reduction of water and energy consumption plays an important role to an enterprise like royal unibrew and much has happened on that front since 2003 our energy consumption per hectolitre produced has been more than halved that has required both large and small changes csr even small changes may have a great effect when it comes to packaging and containers and we are therefore continuously working to optimise this area if say we manage to reduce the weight of a bottle or a can by just a few grams the impact will certainly be felt materials consumption will be lower we will be able to transport more at a time and ultimately our co2 emission will be reduced royal unibrew receives csr company of the year award management report 50 corporate social

same time the coating of surfaces with fluoroplastics generates considerable savings on cleaning materials and solvents as well as water generally plastics are lighter than metal and the lower weight can be used to increase the capacity of transport equipment and thus reduce fuel consumption which is good for the environment obvious examples include rolling stock like agricultural machinery

development sp group follows the 10 principles set out in the un global compact and gives an account of the four areas in the following at the beginning of sp group s largest subsidiary sp moulding a/s joined the global compact environment and climate in accordance with the un global compact sp group takes initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility and reduce the group s impact on the internal and external environment and sp group also seeks to promote the use of more environmentally friendly technologies and materials it is sp group s strategy that all production companies must implement a certifiable environmental management system which ensures use of environment-friendly products in the production and development processes minimisation of waste and refuse as well as resource consumption recycling of materials and products to the widest extent possible a satisfactory working environment for the employees prioritising safety and environmental impacts with the current energy and raw material prices and the increasing waste disposal expenses it is financially sound to reduce energy and raw material consumption and reduce the waste percentage therefore all plants focus on these efforts sp moulding s and ulstrup plast s factories have introduced decentralised grinders on all machines to replace the central grinders this ensures that the remaining material from the production of each component is grinded immediately and led down a closed system together with the plastic material for the next component gibo plast and sp medical use central grinders to ensure reuse of surplus material i other products in this way more of the plastic material can be put into use tinby and ergomat have also improved their processes so that materials are now fed more efficiently which increases the rate of use and reduces waste distribution of employees by geographical area in average 12 0 115 in the period 2013-2015 sp group carried out tests using recycled plastics for selected products plastic wood compound the tests are expected to result in commercial production during thus sp group will contribute to dramatically reduce not only its own but also others environmental impact the goal is to replace wood from rain forests with plastics from sorted household waste the most considerable impact on the environment occurs when the entities in the sp group consume energy particularly power and raw materials during production and divert waste from production the direct co2 emission from the group entities is limited but co2 indirectly impacts the environment when power plants produce power and when products are transported from sp group sp group has no direct impact on the power plants energy production but a substantial part of the power is purchased in denmark from plants producing power from renewable energy primarily wind turbines in respect of transportation sp group selects partners with modern and environmentally friendly equipment plastics produced and used with care have a positive impact on the environment in environmental life cycle analyses plastics generally rank higher than most alternative materials therefore increased use of plastics will reduce the total impact on the environment acid gasses however are produced during production of fluoroplastic coatings but they are removed in a flue gas scrubber before being led out through the chimney and are therefore not a nuisance to the surroundings the use of fluoroplastic coatings is very beneficiary to the environment in many respects they are for example used as corrosion protection in flue gas purifying plants at coal-fired power plants to avoid acid rainwater at the same time coatings of surfaces with fluoroplastics generate considerable savings on cleaning materials and solvents as well as water generally plastics are lighter than metal and the lower weight can be used to increase the capacity of transport equipment and thus reduce fuel consumption thus benefiting the environment obvious examples include rolling stock such as agricultural machinery tractors combine harvesters buses and cars where the exterior parts can be manufactured distribution of employees by geographical area in average 34 13 112 529 612 every month sp group measures a number of key figures relating to consumption of energy heating water and raw materials in all its factories the measurement results are used for internal benchmarking and for wide implementation of initiatives which at some plants have proved to lower resource consumption if

theme topic was chosen because people have discussed for decades how gender equality leads to better business thus the theme topic gender career harmonizes with the ideal of business-driven social responsibility its purpose being to promote gender equality to maximize talent potential regardless of gender and to create an even better match between the bank s customers and the staff and executives who advise them spar nord s commercial target group consists of ordinary retail customers and local businesses it is desirable therefore for the bank to have a broad composition at both non-executive and executive level in terms of gender this means that the bank has an aim of being an attractive workplace for both men and women one where harmonious interaction exists between working life and private life recognizing that the current reality does not match the bank s goals and intentions spar nord has launched a targeted action aimed at increasing the number of women in executive positions gender career has therefore been designated a joint action area for the group as a whole and a theme under which both central and local actions will be initiated spar nord annual report 46 organization and responsibility a project organization has been created at group level to run the gender career project project responsibility has been assigned to the hr department and a working group has been set up the working group will report to the joint consultative committee and consists of executive and staff representatives drawn from various parts of the group executive board local banks support and staffs with even gender distribution large age span and wide geographical coverage action areas highlights among the initiatives implemented in targets and follow-up initiatives the purpose of the gender career initiative is to improve spar nord s ability to activate the human and leadership resources within its work force and specifically therefore to ensure equal career opportunities in the group for both sexes investing with care the overarching goal is to interest more women in an executive career with the spar nord group another key objective is for both sexes to improve the retention of executives by balancing career with recreation and family life in concrete terms the goal has been formulated thus in there should be at least three qualified applicants for executive positions at the bank and in there should be at least five at least one of which should be a woman in the long term the number of women attending the pitstop management course should be at least 50 in addition to these goals we also continually follow the distribution of gender at executive and mid-level executive level we also carry out job satisfaction and performance analyses broken down by gender in a number of specific areas barriers to creating the desired career potential for creating good balance between work and family life benefit from staff performance appraisals feedback and follow-up from an employee s immediate manager satisfaction with development potential review of communication material evaluation of job position profiles and recruitment procedures establishment of mentor programmes targeted at female managerial talents integration of gender and career in staff performance appraisals ph.d. project on gender and career as a bank and an asset manager our mission is to generate positive returns for our customers at the same time our goal is to establish long-term customer relationships while acting with respectful awareness of our surroundings this also goes for the investment area thus the overarching goal is to generate sustainable value in the long term a central building block of the market risk policy adopted by spar nord bank s supervisory board in is that the bank is exclusively interested in transactions that conform to good banking practice and do not jeopardize the group s reputation and professional profile thus instead of having an outright mission statement spar nord s supervisory board has adopted a dynamic wording that reflects the intention to be in tune with market requirements and expectations at all times in light of the limited investment volume and spar nord bank s clout as an investor and owner this approach is thought to be both sensible and relevant in practice the market risk policy means that spar nord does

considering spar nord s relatively limited investment footprint spar nord annual report 47 granting credit with respect to the business relationships that the bank wants to establish spar nord has the same clear ethical guidelines in the credit-granting area as it does in the investment area spar nord s credit policy statement specifies that the bank is exclusively interested in transactions that conform with good banking practice and do not jeopardize the bank s reputation and professional profile the bank does not want to establish credit facilities with customers whose origin and background are such that maintaining a business relationship with them may damage the bank s reputation who refuse to submit recent accounting material who have inflicted losses on the bank in the past whose circumstances in general are such that maintaining a business relationship with a particular company or business might jeopardize the bank s reputation employees spar nord bank s most important business asset is a force of highly skilled and satisfied employees who have excellent relations with customers we believe that employees who are professionally stimulated are healthy and maintain a suitable balance between work leisure time and family life achieve the best results consequently it is our main priority to ensure our employees personal development job satisfaction and health both by taking initiatives at central level and by supporting local and personal initiatives in addition we aim for equal treatment and equal pay and want to promote diversity among our employees and managers there are no precise data on the number of employees affected by stress but at spar nord the level of work absence due to sickness has for many years been significantly below the sector average the most recent figure being 2.7 in against a sector average of 3.2 competence development one of the chief action areas in the efforts to attract and retain employees is the personal and professional development of the bank s employees the cornerstone of spar nord s efforts to boost competence development is the annual performance appraisal review at which the employee s individual training plan is discussed and an agreement made on further action in training terms in addition to the performance appraisal review all employees have the option of an annual competence interview during which the employee s professional social and personal competences are discussed and a competence profile is prepared since 1998 spar nord has worked determinedly to identify and develop talents and executive candidates from our own rank and file efforts are structured in the so-called pitstop programme a twoyear development programme focusing on management and businessmanship the objective of the programme is to develop and retain potential mid-level executives and senior executives and thus ensure that competent candidates for executive positions in the group are generally available in-house we also want to ensure that future executives will understand how to communicate the bank s vision values and strategy and are capable of translating strategy into day-to-day operations the training programme gives professional merits equivalent to a so-called pre-mba work-life balance spar nord s commitment to ensuring a healthy balance between work recreation and family life for its employees has previously been mentioned in connection with the theme topic gender career another important action area relating to positive working life is stress prevention and stress management prevention of stress has been a focus area at spar nord for many years and in a new initiative was launched entitled job satisfaction and stress supported by a workbook e-learning and staff

could put our resources to better use if we channel them into other activities than spending them on reporting to the un gender career since the theme topic gender career has been the special focus area selected this particular theme topic was chosen because people have discussed for decades how gender equality leads to better business thus the theme topic gender career harmonizes with the ideal of business-driven social responsibility its purpose being to promote gender equality to maximize talent potential regardless of gender and to create an even better match between the bank s customers and the staff and executives who advise them spar nord s commercial target group consists of ordinary retail customers and local businesses it is desirable therefore for the bank to have a broad composition at both non-executive and executive level in terms of gender this means that the bank has an aim of being an attractive workplace for both men and women one where harmonious interaction

297,TK Development,ANN,2011,statutory annual corporate social responsibility statement in addition to carrying on profitable business activities tk development intends to adhere to and expand the group s ethical social and environmental responsibilities as a business corporation tk development fundamentally endorses the un s ten social responsibility principles but has not acceded to the un global compact the group only carries on activities in countries that have already incorporated human rights labour standards and anti-corruption principles into their national legislation the supervisory board has yet to introduce policies that integrate corporate social responsibility in all key areas of its strategy and activities the group targets and implements its corporate social responsibility measures as described below employees and working environment the know-how networks talents and expertise of tk development s employees make them a significant competitive asset consequently the group is dedicated to giving its employees an attractive working environment in which they can develop this means showing respect for and taking an interest in the individual employee within the scope of its available options the group aims to show flexibility for example by accommodating employees who need to temporarily reduce their working hours or the like due to serious illness or for other reasons the group has a consistent and transparent staff policy that allows room for diversity and development in addition the group offers an employee benefits programme aimed at ensuring the employees personal development job satisfaction and health while also maintaining a focus on providing the best possible working conditions and environment across the group the ultimate goal is to foster a staff team of highly motivated and committed employees thus tk development has generally succeeded in keeping work absence due to illness and the staff turnover rate satisfactorily low in future tk development will also focus on employee job satisfaction and maintain the current level of employee benefits the local community tk development strives to design projects that support growth in the local community the group s business 36/123 tk development a/s annual report 2010/11 management 's review concept plays a role in strengthening the local business environment and lifting local employment the group develops its projects together with local politicians organizations tenants and investors thus integrating the needs and wishes of all stakeholders to reach the best possible solution for everyone involved thus the employees in the group acquire important knowhow about the various stakeholders needs and wishes this helps ensure swift decision-making processes and efficient progress in the development of individual projects in the group the group s dedicated efforts in the local community also mean that tk development enters into sponsorships/cooperation agreements with local players in the culture and sports sectors green building the group is experiencing increasing demand for green buildings from both tenants and investors tk development offers to construct green buildings as and when requested by the group s customers a case in point is the group s retail park in danderyd sweden which has been constructed as a green building according to current swedish standards tk development has succeeded in having the group s sillebroen shopping centre in frederikssund denmark certified according to breeam standards achieving the very good rating it has also been decided to obtain breeam certification of the group s projected shopping centre in esbjerg denmark with the aim of achieving the good or very good rating environment tk development is keenly aware that the public eye is sharply focused on environmental optimization throughout the construction process public concerns include the reduction of co2 emissions and the sustainability of building projects when the group acquires sites for its projects the land is examined to determine any contamination if a plot of land is contaminated the group will clean up the land for its intended use before starting construction or refrain from buying the relevant plot when developing projects the group strives to achieve an optimum balance between environmental and social concerns while also generating revenue for the group the choice of materials design energy consumption and environmental impact all form part of such considerations the group aims to complete projects without causing unnecessary environmental impact tk development cooperates with tenants and investors to establish appropriate environmental solutions when developing and implementing new projects for instance the group seeks to create finished projects with low energy consumption and a good indoor climate that will provide a comfortable working environment for future employees tk development does not tolerate bribery and is against any form of corruption management is not aware of any cases of corruption reference is also made to www.tk-development.dk/csr several of the group s projects completed in the

star compliant when designing large and small shopping centres tk development attaches weight to ensuring the availability of convenient public transport options for customers in the czech republic the group s fashion arena outlet center in prague enjoys several public transport links for example a free shuttle bus from the metro station to the outlet centre in denmark one of the entrances to the group s sillebroen shopping centre frederikssund has direct access to bus terminals train station etc suppliers and safety at construction sites on-site safety is a prime concern for tk development at all stages of project construction to this end tk development sets out precise requirements for correct and adequate onsite safety measures in all its construction contracts and requires all group employees to comply with all safety regulations when visiting or working at the construction site the group s own engineers constantly supervise construction sites to ensure compliance with all safety regulations in addition tk development obligates its suppliers to guarantee correct and responsible handling of construction waste as a result tk development has achieved a zero occupational injury rate during work on the group s building sites anti-corruption as stated above tk development only carries on activities in countries where anti-corruption principles have been implemented in applicable law however the group is aware that a risk of corruption may exist in a few countries primarily as a result of cultural conditions management 's review tk development
